Oh fuck! Yes! His filthy words hit my core with a blow, tightening my inner muscles in giddy anticipation. Already I could feel my orgasm brewing, building, every stroke and kiss charging it.

He dropped to his knees, wrenching off my panties with zero regard for the delicate lace. He fused his gaze to my mound, his level stare burning as much as his touch would. My head lolled restlessly against the wall as I mewled my impatience. Again my fingers sought the grip of his hair, wanting to force his mouth onto me.

“I need both hands free baby; you need to help me out.” The low rumble of his voice was insanely erotic as he guided my hands to the sides of my sex. I could feel his freighting breaths tease me, hot and damp as he folded all but two of my fingers away then placed them right beside my glistening lips. I copied what he’d done on the other side so I was bracketing the swollen folds with both sets of fingers.

“Pull up and hold baby,” he commanded and when I complied I damn near convulsed at the reveal, the tremble leaving my legs like jelly. My gasp was more like a pathetic whimper of need. They weren’t shy anymore, hiding between my legs but voluptuous and plump, popping out like lips puckering for a kiss. Not only were they directly in front of his ardent mouth but in my full view as well. I could see the sheen of my arousal, the juicy centre poking through the cleft in spite of the fullness of the outer rounds.
