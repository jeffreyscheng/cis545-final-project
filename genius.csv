1,Eminem,1996 Underground Freestyle,,"Any rapper saying those kind of rhymes
In this day and age in this period of time
Tryna battle Eminem is worse than
David Starr tryna battle Proof, Eye-Ku, BFlat and Bizarre
(unintelligible)
That's why you beg to differ me,you ain't got no style
Plus you lack delivery, not to brag
I don't need to boast
Look, my face is pale, but you look like you seen a ghost
(unintelligible)
You couldn't slip up in the zone, if I put banana peels
Around this fucking microphone
So get a bulldozer, start from bottom to top
And tear this building down
'cause that's the only way you 'recking shop"
2,2Pac,16 on Death Row,R U Still Down? (Remember Me),"Death Row
That's where mothafuckas is endin' up

Dear Mama, I'm caught up in this sickness
I robbed my adversaries but slipped and left a witness
Wonder if they'll catch me or will this nigga snitch?
Should I shoot his bitch or make the nigga rich?
Don't wanna commit murder, but damn, they got me trapped
Hawkin' while I'm walkin' and talkin' behind my back
I'm kind of schizophrenic, I'm in this shit to win it
?Cause life's a Wheel of Fortune, here's my chance to spin it
Got no time for cops who trip and try to catch me
Too fuckin' trigger-happy to let them suckers snatch me
Niggas gettin' jealous, tryin' to find my stash
Whip out the 9, now  pump yo' ass
Peter picked a pepper, but I can pick a punk
Snatched him like a bitch and threw him in the trunk
The punk thought I was bluffin', but swear I'm nothin' nice
Before I take your life, first wrestle with these mites
I listened to his screams until he went insane
I guess the little mites had finally found his brain
New Rovers pull me over, I'm sentenced to the pen
Remember that little bird? He snitched and told a friend
It's trouble on my mind, I'm with the old-timers
And fuck five-0! Blaow, blaow! Turn 'em into forty-niners

Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go
Where they find me; 16 on Death Row

Dear Mama, these cops don't understand me
I turned to a life of crime ?cause I came from a broken family
My uncle used to touch me, I never told you that
Scared what you might do, I couldn't hold you back
I kept it deep inside, I done let it fuel my anger
I'm down for all my homies, no mercy for a stranger
The brother in my cell is 16 as well
It's hard to adapt when you're black
And you're trapped in a living hell
I shouldn't have let him catch me
Instead of livin' sad in jail I coulda died free and happy
And my cellmate's raped on the norm
And passed around the dorm
You can hear his asshole gettin' torn
They made me an animal
Can't sleep, instead of countin' sheep, niggas countin' cannibals
And that's how it is in the pen
Turn old and cold and your soul is your best friend
My mama, pray for me
Tell the Lord to make way for me, prepare any day for me
(Why?) ?Cause when they come for me they find a struggler
To the death I take the breath from your jugular
The trick is to never lose hope
I found my buddy hangin' dead from a rope; 16 on Death Row

Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go
Where they find me; 16 on Death Row

Dear Mama, they sentenced me to death
Today's my final day, I'm countin' every breath
I'm bitter ?cause I'm dyin', so much I haven't seen
I know you never dreamed your baby would be dead at 16
I got beef with a sick society
That doesn't give a shit and they too quick to say goodbye to me
They tell me the preacher's there for me
He's a crook with a book, that mothafucka never cared for me
He's only here to be sure I don't drop a dime to God
About the crimes he's committin' on the poor
And how can these people judge me?
They ain't my peers, and in all these years they ain't never love me
I never got to be a man
Must be part of some big plan to keep a nigga in the state pen
And to my homies out buryin' mothafuckas
Steer clear of these Aryan mothafuckas
?Cause once they got you locked up
They got you trapped, you're better off gettin' shot up
I'm convinced, self-defense is the way
Please stay strapped, pack a gat every day
I wish I woulda known while I was out there
Now I'm straight headin' for the chair

Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go
Where they find me; 16 on Death Row

16 on Death Row, Death Row
Death Row, Death Row
16 on Death Row, Death Row, Death Row
It's to all my partners
In the penitentiaries; 16 on Death Row"
3,2Pac,187 On A Hook (Remix),," (2X)
West side, it's 187 on a motherfucking hook
Niggas out of bounds should have shook
We bangin' by the book
Got shot in the neck tryin' to get away
And to a vigi it ain't nothin' but gun play

HEEY!
Got some static for some niggas on the other side of town
Let my little cousin K roll, he's a rider now
What they want from us motherfuckin' thug niggas?
Used to love niggas, now I plug niggas
And slug niggas, am I wrong?
Niggas makin' songs, tryin' to get with us
Must be gone on stress weed, in the West we trust
To the chest I BUST! Then we ride 'til the sun come
Shinin' back to brighten up the sky, how many die?
Heard the Fugees was tryin' to do me - look bitch!
I cut your face, this ain't no motherfuckin' movie
THEN! We watch the other two die slow
Castrated entertainin' at my motherfuckin' sideshow
BAM! Set my plan in mo', time to exterminate my foes
I can't stand you hoes, uhh
Now label this my fuckin' trick shot
My lyrics runnin' all you cowards out of hip-hop
When we ride - on our enemies

Nigga to catch this nigga, I'm ready to peel one
Instead of the shoulders I gotta distort a nigga's grill some
Vigilante and villains and Regime niggas come with steel guns
Get ready to sleep 'cause you tripped when you fucked with a villain
Which one of y'all motherfuckers said fuck Tech N9ne
Shady Pacino turned C-ho when I clutched that N9ne
Me and my nigga C-Bo Yuk mezzole not only bust that rhyme
We can do it illegal so the evil'll give a fuck next time
Nigga don't you ever spit my name
And thinking that shit's the same
Two-thou' we switched the game and spit the flame (Wah)
""Allah hu akbar"" - is what I say before I buck you
Motherfuck busters like Vell Bakardy yeah nigga had enough ya'll
Get ready to suffer - kneel down
Nigga, Tech N9ne Killer Klown
Nigga, six feet underground is where you're found
Nigga, 40-Water would never did a song wit you if he knew the song
Was about me never make a million
Next time say my name say my name like Destiny's Children - bitch
 (2X)

Come take a journey through my mind's eye
You crossed the game, don't explain
Nigga, time to die, say goodbye
Watch my eyes - when I pull the trigger
So right before you die you bow before a bigger nigga
Now dry your eyes, you was heartless on your hits
Niggas love to scream peace after they start some shit - pay attention
Here's a word to those that robbed me
I murder you then I, run a train on Mobb Deep!
Don't fuck with me!
Nigga you're barely livin', don't you got sickle cell?
See me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin' well, hell
How many niggas wanna be involved?
See I was only talkin' to Biggie
But I'll kill all'a y'all, then ball
Then tell Da Brat to keep her mouth closed
Fuck around and get tossed up, by the fuckin' Outlawz
Before I leave, make sure everybody heard
Know I meant, every motherfuckin' word
When we ride on our enemies

Buck these niggas, I'm a killer screamin' Regime
Deep navis with heat like the A-Team
And when my K scream, it's causin' nothin' but murder
Bucking these niggas makin' hate me
Yeah, nigga, we don't give a fuck, nigga we thug lords
Connected from Tech N9ne and touched for the thug war
Who got love for these niggas with no love
At all give a fuck guns clutched
Only left a ball I know you heard of me - wanna murder me
'Cause I'm the nigga that cooked the bird (?) in the kitchen
Moms itchin' had the whole gang unwrappin' chickens
Nigga and we was headed for the jack strapped
With a fat gat, all my niggas down to rat-tat-tat-tat
West coast bad boys we was yellin'
Now West Coast Mafia Regime and thug zellin' Nigga

1970 somethin', 1970 somethin'
1970 somthin'

1970 somethin'
Nigga I don't sweat the date, my moms is late
So I had to plan my escape, out the skins
In this world, the fly girl
Tanqueray or Hennessy until I called Earl
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck
I wish moms would hurry up so I could get buck
While, Juvenile rippin' mics and shit
New York, New York ready for the likes of this
Uh, then came the worst date, May, 21st
2:19 is when my mama's water burst
No spouse in the house, so she rolls herself
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical chord's wraped around my neck
I'm seein' my death, and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringin' mad joy
The doctor looked and said ""He's gonna be a Bad Boy.""

I remmember back in time
(1970 somethin', 1970 somethin')
Before all the homies died
Before all the dollars and nines
I knew that I was goin' somewhere
Let me take you back in time
(19, 70 somethin', 1970 somethin')
Before I even got the rhyme, before I had nickels and
Dimes, I knew that I was goin' somewhere

Would 'Pac be alive, if you let 'Pac drive?
Swear to God, to reverse, that I'll give my Left Eye
With the right I'll visualize the king of Bed-Stuy
Checkin' his daughter, Tyanna into junior high
If I was in Brooklyn and B.I. was still alive
In 2006, it might sound like this
NY, 7-1-8's, 2-1-2's
With Sue's rendezvous, it's like Moulin Rouge
High fashion, uptown Air Force Ones and Vasquez
Puerto Ricans with fat asses
Blazed dutch masters, we dump ashes
On models in S classes for you bastards
Catch a cab to Manhattan, with that Broadway actin'
You hype, that Belly shit'll get you capped and wrapped in plastic
Tell the captain to ask Rog' What's Happenin'?
I hear, nor speak no evil inside the magnum

(1970 somethin', 1970 somethin')
I remmember back in time
Before all the homies died
Before all the dollars and nines
I knew that I was goin' somewhere
(19, 70 somethin', 1970 somethin')
Let me take you back in time

Now I'm thirteen, smokin' blunts makin' cream
On the drug scene, fuck a football team
Riskin' ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearin' the coach scream ain't my lifetime dream
I mean, I wanna blow up, stack my dough up
So school, I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up
Mom said that I should grow up, and check myself
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself
Put the drugs on the shelf, nah, couldn't see it
Scarface, king of New York, I wanna be it
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated, kinda scary
C-74, Mark 8 set me straight
Not able to move behind a great steel gate
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?
All the money I stacked, was all the money for bail

I remmember back in time
(1970 somethin', 1970 somethin')
Before all the homies died
Before all the dollars and nines
I knew that I was goin' somewhere
Let me take you back in time
(1970 somethin', 1970 somethin')
Before I even got the rhyme, before I had nickels and
Dimes, I knew that I was goin' somewhere
And I knew that I was going somewhere

5,The Notorious B.I.G.,1991 Block Party Freestyle,,"Yes it's me, the B.I.G
Competition ripper ever since 13
Used to steal clothes was considered a thief
Until I started hustlin' on Fulton Street
Makin' loot, knockin' boots on the regular
Pass the microphone I'm the perfect competitor
Jewels and all that, my clothes is all that
Chumps steppin' to me, that's where they took a FALL at!
B.I.G. without burner, that's unheard of
I stay close to mine like Tina on Turner
Quick to smother, a punk motherfucker
Undercover, word to mother, I'm above ya
And I love ya, cause you're a sweet bitch
A crazy crab, the type to make my dick itch
I flow looser than Luther, words ya get used ta
B.I.G. is a born trooper
Like ice cream I scoop ya, my music you wanna get loose ta
Stay pimp, and I'm not a booster
So what'cha got to say? This mackin' word is bond
There's no other assumption, I got it going on
I'm not conceited, my friends tell me this
Even my mother, be noddin' her head to this
Makes her proud to see her one son get loud
Flip on a sucker, and bow to the crowd
Drink a little Hennessy, smoke a blunt or 2 or 3 or 4
Live in action, guaranteed RAW (dumb ass nigga)"

Escobar season begins
Repent your sins
Nine-Six

Check it
Spark the lye with the eight-forty I fly
Pretty thug show no love its like when doves cry
Maybe I'm just too demanding, parked the Land
Mark Buchanan, fuck a job I'mma die scramblin
Digger gold, dig a bigger hole in ya soul
Que Pasa, Pablo's throne cabron
At the airport the Mobb picked me up in a truck
Jewelry chunky like fuck never scared to get stuck
So whats the deal Papi?
Heard the feds could of knocked me
Had the cuban posse all up in my room and lobby
Negotiating, my name holds weight, we motivatin'
Hustling, as if God was dancing with Satan
The Firm waitin', to get ajourned cause we facing
Double life, thuggin for life, you taste it
The white numbin ya toungue
I bought it from Dominicans
A suitcase of benjamins swung tight in his fingers
Had the Firm gun slingers, hit the lights, grab the white
Murder everything in site, and jet in the Bimmers
Now im home with the phone screaner
Resting the stones in a jewelry cleaner
Checkin my mail reading my supoena
To the witness standing, I got remanded
Livin on the 4th building and can't stand it
Gotta fight my case from the inside
Niggas telling, I felt it coming when my pockets started swelling
But thats the game for ya
Hid a stash to ya lawyers
Supreme court, Queens New York will bore ya'
Suited up, booted up, with the jail cut
Million dollar bail what?
Z put up the house and I was out
Word the Fuck Up
Time to get the shit on son
Tryna trap a nigga
Incarcerate me yo'
Check it tho, yo, yo
Im gonna make it if I try, cross my heart hope to die
(cross my heart hope to die)
Im gonna make it if I try, cross my heart hope to die
Praise the Lord, ive been scarred with hot water
Days are shorter, next court dates around the corner
Money ain't the same, shit is outta order
Since the days of Rich Porter
Something gotta give, I ain't trying to bid
Now I run up in cribs, body shit, but no women no kids
In the Bridge where the murderers live
I used to make a quarter million monthly
I was ill until they sunk me
Killed the snitch with the pump 3 shots
Bought a passport off a junkie
The Firm helped me flee out the country
Word and I'm out, Pakastinian land
Chilling with my man Jungle
The commissioner Stout

Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde: Hov' and B

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end, just me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end, just me and my boyfriend

The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
That ain't 'bout nothin'
If ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect
Nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' that Herm?s Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, Aviator lens
600 drops, Hercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep!

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end, just me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end, just me and my boyfriend

(Talk to 'em, B!) If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me
Yeah-hee (Break it down for 'em, B!)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end, just me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end, just me and my boyfriend"

Hundred dollar bills

Yellow cars, yellow gold like Slick Rick, still tip
On four-four's (Who?) Four-four's at the 4-0 (Wait) for O
Dollars fall on the skin, some might call it sin
Politicians all move for money, what the hell are we calling 'em?

12,Snoop Dogg,10 Lil' Crips,Tha Blue Carpet Treatment,"Ten little Crip niggas runnin outside
All from the turf and they bangin out lives
Far from a scrub cuzz from the Eastside
Where they don't die they just multiply
So.. don't give them niggas a reason
To turn it into spray season
Don't give them niggas a reason
Because they'll turn it into Crip season

The gangsta's back, the bank is fat
The gangsta MAC, in a gangsta 'llac
Hmm.. fools be like, ""Break off some cheese""
Friends and enemies, aww nigga please
Fuck, you thought who pumped you up
Stop, you stuck too much, pop, drop, you plucked
It's all similar to gettin laaaid
On ya back when the motherfuckin K spraaays
I grind for my shine about my bidness
Lunatic on the shit and I get ignit (ignit)
Gonna proceed to squeeze with ease
One of these, they can't believe how I leave 'em
Look into a mind of a nigga that's crazy
Seventeen years old and still a baby
Gangstas real, they pop the pill
You cap back, young motherfucker it's like that


Wake up in the morning lookin funny and shit
Fuck a honey dip.. cause I got money to get
Ain't no books, ain't no help, ain't no role to this
Stay focused young homey, that's the code to this
Keep a strap in ya pocket when you trip through the towns
There's a million motherfuckers tryna get you down
A lot of pain in this game, cocaine is the thang
If ya money right then you might get you a chain
But if ya money is low, there's only one way to go
Jack a rapper at a local rap radio show
So mean, so green, crip back to the block
Then brag to the homies, show 'em what you got
It's a gangsta jack (gangsta jack), in gangsta black (black)
And they thought we just gangsta rapped
Yeah nigga, we take your snaps
Your shooby dooby, hooroobies, and your Scooby snacks (It's like that?)
It's like that!


It's a whole lot of fillin when you on the Eastside
On the Eastside, nigga we ride
And it's a whole lot of dealin when you on the Eastside
On the Eastside, nigga we ride
And it's a whole lot of stealin when you on the Eastside
On the Eastside, nigga we ride
And it's a whole lot of killin when you on the Eastside

14,Dr. Dre,187um (Deep Cover Remix),Deep Cover (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),"Niggas that I used to know and sold dope wit'
Listen to how a motherfucker flow shit
And let me know it's somethin' they can blast on
Thinkin' about the homies that passed on
Death Row come to show you where all the game at
And show you how my label got the name that
So many wanna see me in, time is money
But never in the P-E-N, yo
Welcome back to Vietnam, California
Ain't a damn thing changed, so let me warn ya
Every motherfuckin minute you on the Westside
The best side, 20 niggas done just died
Walkin' down the streets of L.A
Stay strapped 'cause niggas bust caps every day, yo
The 1-8-7 don't stop
On undercover cops up on the spot gettin' popped, shot
Droppin' like this and like that
Rat-tat-tat-tat with their caps peelin' back
So creep when you in the C-P-T
You catch heat for fuckin' with' the D-R-E
I got my eyes on the shit unfoldin'
And there ain't gonna be no trippin'
'Cause they know the type of shit that I be holdin'
If there's another word said
I'll let my .44 go buck to the head, nigga

Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop

3 and to the 2 and 2 and to the 1
Head away, sent away, get away, Snoop's got a gun
And he's lookin' for the cops who set him up in '86
Now it's time to put they ass in the mix
Back on the streets with my khakis and my stars
Nuts full of cavi and I'm headed for the bar
Scared than a muthafucka, 'cause I'm fresh out
But I gots to make my green, and plus they all fiend
Follow me, they keep yellin' murder, but it won't stop
Until the last nigga that you know drop
Another nigga out, but I doubt
That you really give a fuck what it's about
Now, 99 pigs on a block with me
Not a muthafuckin' cop wanna knock with me
A C-O-N-V-I-C-T
The motherfuckin' D-O-G, comin' from the L-B-C
Look at what the Doc brought in
A chrome .38, a .44 mag, and Mac 10
So what you wanna do? (What you wanna do?)
I got the gauge, a Uzi and my mothafuckin' .22
So if you wanna blast, nigga we can buck 'em
If we stick 'em then we stuck 'em so fuck 'em!

Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop

Splat to a motherfucker face, he fall
Strong muthafucka 'cause he starts to crawl
I guess I gots to load the Glock again
Hit 'im with the hollow points and watch him spin
Fuck it, I had to do this quick
Grabbed the Glock 17, the clip went click
Tried to detect, but did not detect perfect
So I creep on that ass, pops him and drops him
That ought to stop from beatin' up blacks
Dead in his tracks, from a full six pack
Relax, 'cause I'm about to take my respect
I aimed the 12 gauge straight for his neck
Boo-yaa! Boo-yaa! then I fade into the wind
1-8-7 and it's on again
Well it's on, and it's on, and it's on, and it's on
Fo'-fo' Desert Eagle to your motherfuckin' dome
And it's on, and it's on, and it's on, and it's on
Fo'-fo' Desert Eagle to your motherfuckin' dome
Fuck 'em, buck 'em, if they really wanna trip
Niggas keep your hands on your motherfuckin' shit

Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop"

16,Kendrick Lamar,2018 Grammys Performance,,"Part I: XXX.
America, God bless you if it's good to you
America, please take my hand
Can you help me underst?

Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done
He said: ""K-Dot, can you pray for me?
Been a messed up day for me
Know that you anointed, show me how to overcome.""
He was lookin' for some closure
I can bring him closer
Spiritual, my spirit do no better, but I told him
""I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody killed my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed.""
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I'll wait in front a homie's spot and watch him hit his block
I'll catch the homie leavin' service if that's all I got
I'll chip a homie, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, ""Man, I did that!""
Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you play with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my mama
Touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece
Touch my nephew, man, I promise
You chip the homie, then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention
Call you back?
The screen reads: ""This is a satire by Kendrick Lamar""

It's not a place
(Uh-huh)
This country is to me a sound of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around
It's not a place

This country is to me a thought that offers grace
For every welcome that is sought
Part II: DNA.
Run your life, I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice
On your life, I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice
Run your life, I live a--
Run your life (ahh)
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages
Tell me somethin'
Uh, you can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA is an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floor
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the camera
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder ? these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Won't you tell'em I got millions on the way

Hi, I'm Dave Chappelle. And I just wanted to remind the audience that the only thing more frightening than watching a black man be honest in America is being an honest black man in America. Sorry for the interruption, please continue...

Twenty twin twins, yeah, yeah

Red light, green light, red light, green light
Red light, green light, they like, we like
Fast cars, fast money, fast life, fast broads
Egotistic, goin' ballistic, why God?
Born warrior, lookin' for euphoria, but I don't see it
I don't feel it, I'm paraplegic, tapped in when I'm maxed in
Comp-Town with the MAC 10s and the pumps in the background
Absent, never OG, standout
Lackin' everything else but doubt
Magnum, holding Magnums with a Magnum
Homie, ad-lib and I sing out loud
Never had friends, never had ends, never had hope
They was like, ""Nope,"" I was like, ""Boo yaow, boo yaow""

Is this on cable? CBS? It looks like it's singing and dancing, but this brother's taking enormous chances. Rumble, young man, rumble!
Part V: King's Dead
Never had friends, never had ends
Never had hope, they was like ""nope""
I was like ""boo yaow""
(Yeah, God)
Tee off the day
Know we off the, be off the, eat off your plate
Throw me off, I be, ""Off ya head""
Well ate, on C4, I'm way off the edge
Burn integrity, burn your pedigree, burn your feelings
Burn your culture, burn your moral, burn your family
Burn your job, burn your land, burn your children, burn your wives
Who am I? Not your father, not your brother
Not your reason, not your future
Not your comfort, not your reverence, not your glory
Not your heaven, not your angel, not your spirit
Not your message, not your freedom
Not your people, not your neighbor
Not your baby, not your equal
Not the title y'all want me under
All hail King Killmonger"

I know a hundred times
I'd go back to her

You go back to...

I, I love you much - it's not enough

Bungee cord jumpin' off a bridge
It's hard to breathe with a fractured rib
I can't take this shit
Let me see how much more time I got to spend
Hit more skins
Back up in her pussy
Up in the butt
I gotta let off

I'm starting to panic
I'm starting to sweat

Dizzy spells, flashbacks in my head
Niggas ain't want me to bein' happy when I'm dead

Of sand drop from the hourglass
It's how much time I got left on this planet
Some motherfucker's gotta die!
I'm an evil motherfucker ready to tear shit up
I'm gonna put these things on you, and never let up
See, my momma...she was wrong when I was born
That a nigga like E should'a never been born
Too late, big mistake in '72
It's '92, now the year of code blue
15 hours..11 minutes..30 seconds
I'm a motherfuckin' wreck
Gonna pay back niggas who did me wrong in the past
My days ain't long
I'm comin' strong and fast
Lock up 8 niggs..kill up 10 pigs
Innocent and fuckers are also dyin, too
Now what else can I do?
Fuck, fuck, fuck and plant my seeds

Shut the fuck up nigga

I'm holdin' the neck of the devil and drink his blood
Allowing my soul to be polluted by his evil root
And now I'm mad insane, red as rose as I strain for my hearbeat
To thumpety-thump to pump, it might burst
False alarms, and no harm that will commit to the E
But now I'm down to an hour 23

What is a minute?
How important is an hour when 24 hours becomes a lifetime
Oooooh, so define how do we define time?

{WHOOOOOO... KID}

Yeah! And you don't stop
I do a 187 on your motherfuckin block
Yeah! And it don't quit
It's G-Unit in your motherfuckin ass bitch~!

They say good things should happen to those who wait
But I'm stuck in the game still slingin weight
For that eggshell white, that tan and the brown
For a XL-6 or a seven four pound
Suede seats is hot but Italian leather is better
And with cameras in the mirror, nigga cars costs cheddar
I'm on first class flights, with flyin cooks
Cause my verse sound nice when they fly in hooks
Now I'm blowin weed yo, in Beverly Hills
With some bad freak hoes in the Montreal
Next year it's the new Hummer, stash box with the llama
I drive through in the blue data bomber
Heaven or hell'll prevail when I'm a goner
Cause I eat up tracks, like Hannibal and Dahmer
I'm the first one out, and last one on the corner
Cause life is a hustle, any day you be a goner
P89 Ruger with the silencer
Let off a clip it sound like spitballs goin through straws
We got, plenty of ratchets but not on sale
We even got villagers that hold shotgun shells
These rappers is talkin 'bout bricks in they rhymes
You never did shit but some Mickey Mouse crimes
I don't respect it, my work is never watered down
So on the first I get mo' checks than Nike Town
Sling in thirty-one hundreds, I been on the block
Since niggas did the snake, running man and the wop
When I was 15, I ain't want no workin papers
I played the strip all night, servin niggas
Listen nigga, we live like Italians in jail
I got C.O.'s bringin cell phones to my cell
Get rich in the game, niggas out to get you
Fill your ass up with led turn yo' ass to a pencil
I jumped out with the Ruger rapid-fire
I had you on the run like Omar on ""The Wire""
I'm the only rapper you know that stay on the run
I'm the only rapper you know that stay with a gun
I'm a hustler, O.G.'s love to hate
Cause I got old school money put away in the safe
You can catch me in the hood where that dope and coke at
Or you can catch me in cali in the Hollywood throwback
I'm a bail jumper, you know them fish scale pumper
Fuck Judge Wong, he won't catch me on the corner
Nigga pay poor tax, homey you owe me
You wanna rap we can battle for your see through Roley
I be in M mansion, strippin them models
His bathroom's so far you gotta piss in a bottle
There's too many indians and not enough chiefs
Why you buy all the guns if you ain't got enough beef
The shit I spit'll cause an all out riot
And my new four-fifth'll cause a hollow-tip diet
I'm the type to tie up your lady, and gun butt your baby
I'm like the mob nigga, fuck you pay me~!
I'mma hide my assets, and disappear
Make a quick twenty mill' and vanish in thin air
I've finished my work now its time to cop
And meet that Chinese lady at the baggage spot
I need twelve 12's, and fifty-eight 58's
Cause I got eight sales and they all gon' wait motherfucker!

Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need, and I
Like your smile, I don't want to see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask
And I hope you can come up with the answers, babe

Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt, would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work, would you be down to ride?
I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive
I'm askin' questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap ?cause I flip burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feelin' me?
In the bed, if I used my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now we can have a little drink, you know, a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that

Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

Would you leave me if your father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin'?
Are you mad ?cause I'm askin' you 21 questions?
Are you my soulmate? ?Cause if so, girl, you a blessing
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
I'm starin' at you, tryna figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down, would you say things to make me smile?
I'll treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me, or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans, girl, we make mistakes
To make it up, I'll do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style, I say anything to make you smile

Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now

When I realize what I missed, but as of now my eyes are dry
'Cause I'm trying to stay alive
In the city where too many niggas die
Dreamin' quiet trying to dodge a suit and tie
Who am I?
Aye who am I? (Yeah)

Things change, rearrange and so do I
It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie
I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

I always did shit the hard way
My nigga Squirrel slangin' in the hallway
Burnt CD's and trees like this was Broadway
Times Square, kept the dimes there in the locker
Some Reggie Miller
With more brown hairs than Chewbacca
Whispers that he got it for the low-low, sell a
Dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better
Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?
He tell his pops he need some lunch
And he gon' get it right back
I peep game
Got home snatched my mama keychain
Took her whip, the appeal, too ill to refrain
I hit the boulevard pull up to my nigga front do'
His mama at home, she still let 'em hit the blunt though
I told her hello, and sat with my nigga and laughed
And talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class
I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash
And just asked, ""What a nigga gotta do to get that?
Put me on,"" he just laughed when he seen I was sure
17 years breathing his demeanor said more
He told me, ""Nigga, you know how you sound right now?
If you wasn?t my mans
I would think that you a clown right now
Listen, you everything I wanna be that's why I fucks with you
So how you looking up to me when I look up to you?
You bout to go get a degree, I'ma be stuck with two choices:
Either graduate to weight or selling number two
For what? A hundred bucks or two a week?
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me?
I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us
If they ain't want us why the fuck they never wore rubbers?""
I felt ashamed to have ever complained about my lack of gear
And thought about how far we done came
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
Thank you mama, dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry
You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted
I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't gon' take what they handed
Nah, I'm gon' take what they owe me
And show you that I can fly
And show old girl what she missing, the illest nigga alive
Aye who am I?

Things change, rearrange and so do I
(Aye who am I?)
It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie
(Who am I?)
I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

I never felt better"

Niggas want me to busta rhymes, so ironic
It's Busta Rhymes, so iconic
Niggas can't fuck wit the kid, you know the logic
Bounce dookie should move, 'fore we make it a topic
I'm shitting on niggas to where I need a colonic
Or when I'm showing up and only collecting the profit
Sha, sha, sha, que sera is how I picks it up
Making niggas put holes in the wall is how I rip shit up
'Tron, a lil yak and some kush is how I mix it up
I love the way she gets down on her knees and how she licks it up
The way a nigga give you the shit and how he thinks it up
Look, pardon me, yeah look, peep how I lift shit up

Woo! Yeah, yeah

Tell my homies clap off from the clap, Let's get it!

Clap off, clap on, bitch see we back on
Wall in the west wing, hang all my plaques on
I be blacking in this bitch 'til the whole track gone, King Kong
Got 'em bouncing off the walls, ping pong
Rolls Royce Wraith seats, I'm resting my back on
Bottles of 1942, getting my drank on
Funny how my mommy say she love my new rap song
How a nigga keep it fresh, Balmain slacks on
Now that's wrong, she ripping off her new black thong
Now she bugging, shorty, can't believe the dick that long
Collapse on the couch inside of my mansion
Wish y'all niggas could've really seen my reaction

Woo! Yeah, yeah
I just dropped a big bag
On a brand new
AAAHHHH!!!
Yeah I just pulled up to the club
With the top all gone, new

The wu is coming through you know the outcome
Critical

The officer and gentleman who stack by the benjamen

Off a beat like this
I keep a night stick
In case any stick up care where heat might miss
I chicken fry rice bitch
In a white trench
Bustin off two macks I'm like ""I'm hit""!!!

Shotgun in this man car
Burnin up
Forever gettin thrown out the club
It be us Paul
Shot out and bugged
I smoke bud, sniff a bee's ass to get a buzz
I'm everything you think you don't know

I throw a 5 in the power
Poppa wheely with the front end hittin speed bumps, 40 miles per hour
I'm out at Howard, next to Baltimore
Takin change out the fountains at shoppin malls
Rats can only afford Chuck E Cheese
The blood in my jeans is tough like Buddy Lee
Semi-dart auto off ya, blood coughin
Meth pull the last spark plug with a heart pump

Call me will, enemy I state
When 4 Doc run the scam
New jacks studderin, that the man from the upperhand
Punch, atomic bomb I hit many
From Bricks to South Park you dyin with Kenny
While you bailin I'm trailin
Rockin hard hat helmets clip the satellite servallence
When I walk by you better not be kickin
Or I put two more in that terriyaki chicken

You've just been fitted for them seeman shoes
This is bottom of the lake raps
Stab you in the back

52 cops can't withstand the 52 blocks
Unless they bust like 52 shots

Battle kids at Maxwell's house

What's my name Meth he's name Doc
Just like urban
See me in the gran transportation splurgin
Drivin with a turban who push a black suburban (come on)
We rollin windows half down through the urban
Network law lay it down like a persian
M to the E to the F, spell curtain

Get out your car sucker
This ain't yours
Robbed you with a gun that filled with paint balls
And brauds got the nerve to act funny
You a champaine ho, with kool aide money
Frown bitch, Doc up in that town quick

Like I?m Kenny Smith
But I ain?t Kenny
Kenny can shoot it
But can he spit?
This ain?t for morons
Hashtag NEW Yiddi trick, and oxymorons
Fat broads who skinny dip
The War Report on
Better come with your sword on
I hit ya with that Cee-Lo Green
You know that short arm
The people caught on (wait)
I meant to say the People?s Court on (wait)
For the record I hope record on (brake)
Before I wreck it
Too many styles to go on
Wu-Tang is for the children
Go get ya child support on

I ain?t tryna bring the city back
And all that pretty boy rap
Ain?t where I?m really at
Besides rappers don?t really ride
They piggy back - I?ll trade them all
To have 2Pac & Biggie back
Facts. Don?t give me dap
Don?t want your pity want Fifty Fifty
Just give me that
Want every penny both Hanz on
How many that?
A black president
White house, what's really rap?
We not so friendly at my house (clicky clack)
If necessary, pet cemetery, ya kitty cat ? Won?t let em eat
Cause my other problems too many rats
Ya boy a beast on this mic Jack
Da ratchet tryna peel (pill) ya like Mike Jack
Call that thriller a nite cap
Take a moment to suck it up
But make it brief nobody cared if ya cow died
Don?t make it beef
Rap game we own it
We really in these streets
You rap lames is homeless
You really in the streets

I ain?t tryna bring the city back
And all that pretty boy rap
Ain?t where I?m really at
Really how sillys that?
Besides rappers don?t really
Ride they piggy back

Said we're lookin' for a brighter day
Said we're lookin' for a brighter day
Said we're lookin' for a brighter
Said we're lookin' for a brighter day
Said we're lookin' for a brighter day
Said we're lookin' for a brighter day
Said we're lookin' for a brighter day
Said we're lookin' for a brighter day
Yo, I speak in whole beat legends
Divide it up in parts and sections
Days I was ministerin' sectors
Direct from the spot, forgotten on your election
Jail laced with fragments, speech clipped with accents
Phenomenal ave and for future and the past tense
Blew up the room in my absence
Live or closed caption watch my song vibrate with passion
The response in action to light bulb irrations
I come from where anything can happen and usually does
You find tension where it used to be love
I use my words to shine light inside the dark valleys
The dark alley, U.K., U.S., New York, Cali
From this king to all counties I out loudly
The clammer ? the chain of things that surround me
And seek bounty or stay stridin' and keep strivin'
I seek guidance, like the sun at the dawn I keep risin'
Like that y'all
Brighter day came my way
Had to decide was I gonna stay
Packed my things and I moved on (move on, move on)
That was the day that it all begun
Yo yo yo nobody knows what tomorrow holds, could be pot of gold
Or a mere pot on top ya stove, still ya got to roll
Climb my obstacles and honor those who paved the harder road
Blazed the trails so a brighter day wasn't far to go
So many stories aren't told, so many lights that aren't shone
Still the world remain ignorant to what the heart should know
My love is audio, transmitted, heard, and felt
My words are mirrors to nearer and observe yourself
To receive (ceive), reflect (reflect), magnify
Let a bright light heal a damaged eye
We hold fort like family ties
Shout the battle cry and what we challenged by
Make the shady stand aside so ? risers can arrive
From native to the natural lives you can't deny the natural vibe
On a Mayfield natural high, artificials can abide
I love to see my masses rise
The joy to make your banners hot
The stronger people unite the way we lookin' for a brighter day
Brighter day came my way
Had to decide was I gonna stay
I packed my things and I moved on (move on, move on)
That was the day that it all begun (move on)
Begun, brighter day, brighter day
Came away, came away and I flew away, flew away high, so high
I will fly (fly, whoa) fly away, fly away, fly away
Said I'm lookin' for a brighter day
Said I'm lookin' for a brighter day
Said I'm lookin' for a brighter day
Lookin' for a brighter day
Said I'm lookin' for a brighter day
Lookin' for a brighter day
Said I'm lookin' for a brighter day
Said I'm lookin' for a brighter day
Lookin' for a brighter day
Lookin' for a brighter day
Lookin' for a brighter day
We are lookin' for a brighter day
Lookin' for a brighter day
Lookin' for a brighter day
Said I'm lookin' for a brighter day
Ay, ay
A brighter day came my way
Had to decide was I gonna stay
I packed my things and I moved on (move on, move on)
That was the day that it all begun (yeah)
Brighter day came my way
I had to decide was I gonna stay
I packed my things and I moved on
That was the day that it all begun
A brighter day came my way
I had to decide was I gonna stay
I packed my things and I moved on
That was the day that it all begun
A brighter day came my way
I had to decide was I gonna stay
Packed my things and I moved on

35,Yasiin Bey,A Ha,True Magic,"Hey hey, ha ha say what say what
Ha ha bust it yo
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, is beautiful Brooklyn
Long as I live here believe I'm on fire hey
Cuz it's the B-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
L-Y-N is the place where I stay
The B-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
Best in the world and all USA
It's the B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
L-Y-N is the place where I stay
The B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
Place where I rest is on my born day
Bust it, sometimes I sit back and just reflect
Watch the world go by and my thought connect
I think about the time past and the time to come
Reminesce on Bed-Stuy when I was pride and young
I used to try and come, to the neighborhood function
Throw on my Izod, say a little something
When I was just a youngin, before the days of thuggin
How me and Charlie Chims (aiyyo what?) I'm only buggin
Fast forward, Nine-Now I gotta team my seed
I must proceed at God's speed to perform my deed
Livin the now space and time, round the nine to five
For as long as I'm alive, paw I got to strive
I ain't sittin roadside, that ain't harder to plan
I'm out here for my fam doin all that I can
I love my city, sweet and gritty in land to outskirts
Nickname Bucktown cuz we grown to outburst
Philosophy redefine us, touch mines I touch back
Walk the streets like a sweet and get beat like drum tracks
Catch no shakes over jakes (boomp-boomp!) we bust back
Bring the marty to your face wit no place to run back
I'm from the slums that created the bass that thump back
This ain't a game clown, play ya James Brown and jump back
What you want, Jack? Young cats stash they jums at
Draw they guns back, momma screams where she sons at
Tryin to hunt that, recurring dream of high stakes
The fourth largest, first artist, Brooklyn is the place
Settled by the judge many years ago
Three billion strong and here we go
GOOD MORNINNNNNNNNNGG VIETNAM!!!
Ha (back up back up back up back up back up) 
Yo sometimes I sit back, reflect on the place that I live at
Unlike any place I ever been at
The home of big gats, deep dish hammer rim caps
Have a mishap, push ya wig back
Where you go to get the fresh trim at
Four on the jake got the Timb rack
Blue collars metro carding it
Thugs mobbin it, form partnership
Increase armorment, street pharmacist
Deep consequence, when you seek sleek ornaments
You get caught, rode the white horse and can't get off
Big dogs that trick off just get sent off
They shoebox stash is all they seeds gotta live off
It's real yo but still yo, it's love here
And it's felt by anybody that come here
Out of towners take the train, plane and bus here
Must be something that they really want here
One year as a resident, deeper sentiment
Shoutout ""Go Brooklyn!"", they representin it
Sittin on they front stoop sippin Guinesses
Usin native dialect in they sentences
From the treeline blocks to the tenaments
To the Mom & Pop local shop menaces
Travel all around the world in great distances
And ain't a place that I know that bear resemblance
That's why we it The Planet
Not a borough or a prov, it's our style that's uncalm
From ?sun? to the ? to the Lafayette Gardens
White ?coff guawinas? in they army jacket linings
Yo this goes out to my cats in Coney Isle
Friday night out in front The Himalaya goin wild
This goes out to Crown Heights and Smurv Village
The nighties, and all my ?yarda trenny? Brown's Village
Parkside tennants caught, thirties, forties, and the fifties
The cats out in Starite City gettin busy
To the Hook, to the East, to the Stuy
Bushwick and Kanarcy, Farraget, Fullgreen, and Marcy
My Flatbush posse, generals of armies
When it's time to form, just call me
And let this song be, playin loud in Long B
If you love Bucktown STRONGLY!
RAISE IT UP!
Brooklyn my habitat, the place where it happen at
Live sway and the sharp balance of the battle axe
Irons is brandished at, thugs draw they hammer back
It's where you find the news tool crew cameras at
It's where my fam is at, summertime jame is at
They play Big and get you open like a sandal back
Hotter than candle wax, hustlin you can't relax
The crack babies tryin to find where they mama's at
It's off the handle black, wit big police scandals that
Turn into actions screenplays sold to Miramax
The type of place where they check your appearance at
And cats who know where all the hot 'lo gear is at
The stompin grounds, where you find a pound, smoke is that
Be blazin charm that have your wave cap floatin back
The doorstep where the disposessed posted at
Dope fiends out at Franklin Ave sellin zovarax
You big ballin better keep your money folded back
Cuz once the young guns notice that it's over, black
Brooklyn keep on takin it, worldwide we known for that
Flossy cats get it snatched like the local tax
The place I sharpen up my baritone vocals at
Where one of the greatest MC's was a local cat"

Diamonds droppin? temperature, bitch I'm one of the finest
And to be honest, I got all these hoes stocked up like sinus, now who you fuckin'?
Ice shining colorful, like a sack of fruit or something
With no heart for bitches like ??? or something
I be the true to nothing thorough nigga, young, raw, and famous
Get money 'til I'm dead or 'til the day of my arraigning
Spittin' game through the platinum smile
You can see the fuck I be saying from half a mile
How I hop out of the colossal Tahoe filled up with models
Poppin' bottles with pussy poppers that gobble until they swallow
See I'm a pimp Playboy when it come to these hoes
Cause all I give is cum to these hoes and run from these hoes
I comfortably roll in the latest sleepy eye Mercedes
Heat up for the haters speed up for the ladies
Miss, so watch your back, and watch your mouth cat
Weezy shit, this our click
You 'bout that? I send my Sqad to where your house at
All of a sudden niggas gs, why the fuck is you trippin'?
I cock and shoot up one of your knees, why the fuck is you trippin'?
You listening? I'm official pimpin'
Be lowkey dippin', Range Ro' be twistin' on blades
I'm O. J. Simpson, pretty limpin'
Big fucking cannon, holding me back
With some shit from off the Discovery Channel on my back
My niggas drowned in smoke, underground, pound daily
My hoes like Nelly cause they go ""Down, down baby""
I used to dog chickens, cluck 'em, fuck 'em, and duck 'em
But now I'm more mature, I fuck 'em, fuck 'em, and fuck 'em
Stuck inside of the game for damn near two decades
And I'ma make you see the insides like a x-ray
Aww fuck...
Huh? Drunk off Cris', mami on e
Weezy on e, mami cummin' on me
The diamond long links sparkle, tough in the light
You do a lil' something tonight, I buy you something with ice
And I ain't stunting a price, shawty I can afford it

Started to order you a Mercedes C 240
But I thought it would be more nice for you in a Ferrari, peep me

It's whatever, holla

Check it, check it

Muhfucka bet' not fuck with this nigga

And my pistols off my hip but I give a shit about who I hit, fuck
I'm fucked up, I'll fuck you up for fucking up
Guns up like ""What's up?"", get your fucking guts cut
Tough luck bruh
Wonder why your bitch act stuck up?
Cause the slut got Weezy nuts stuck up in her fucking butt
Yung mack flip crack quicker than acrobats, get at me man
Look call me Wayne a. k. a. Big Daddy Kane
Nigga can't tell me nothing 'bout the game
Been in that deep shit, every year I'm M. V. P
It's just in me
Rims on the 'Lac like 22 inches
Play with me, I open up your back like 22 inches
Guerrilla pimpin'
And it really isn't wise for niggas to start poppin'
At any given time them niggas could start droppin', peep it
I'm off the strip muhfucka what you want?
This a freestyle coming from off the top out the trunk
Niggas be like Mase and go to Church
But I go to the trunk and then I go to your shirt
Holla at me, I'm the don bitch
Look we can get it on bitch
Gotta get another rap to flow on bitch...
Hold up, aight, aight, aight
Listen, playa, all I do is get bread, I'ma head to them cowards
And if they ever try me, I'll bring y'all the head of them cowards
This big spending, see the heads on them dollars
It's big pimpin', you see your bitch lipstick red on my boxers
Choppers pop at any time for any given reason
Leave 'em not breathing under cement for one disagreement
Freedom, we ride on them bitches, rollin' through sittin' high on them inches
My mission's to make sure Squad get expensive
And if anyone of you niggas better get defensive, your care will get intensive
Shot put humps on top of your head like Bart Simpson
I spark instant, now who want it? I'll light your set
Cause I'm all about money cocksucker, my life a check
I'm spectacular, I let the Tec tackle ya
I spit 16 after ya like I rap with y
Put your chest in the back of ya
You would think a truck hit 'em, it's Weezy, don't fuck with him
Better lock me up or get me to the graveyard quick
Come and get me I spray, spark, spit, it's straight war bitch
Niggas is hoes, like they take long dick
I wave chrome shit at home, shit, make domes split
And may I say these fake niggas on some Ray Charles shit, blind to the fact
9 to ya cap, blat, put your mind in your lap
I ride with the gat for hard times, crimes, and rats
It?s rhymes of the crack, my Sqad, I'll die for that
I climb in the 'Lac, drunk off 190 ?
Don't try me cat, I take this shit beyond the rap
And this Ecstasy is why my eyes are black
Don't like baby moms but the X make her thighs look fat
But fuck the bullshit I grind for scratch, I scrape and scruff, bake and cut
You hatin' us? We tape you up
I spin ya corner make you duck from blazin? bucks
Bandanas, braids, and cuts, I'm gangsta'd up
Muhfucka

Oh, oh shit, oh shit
What they want?
I dont think they want Weezy. Do you think they want Weezy?
Check it, check it

Lil' nigga pass slow in a S 430, ya ho be like ""That's so purty""
Fuck with me I'll show your chest no mercy
Sqad get so dirty, but still we do it clean
Bring action to these fake ass niggas like movie scenes
I pop so much X man I feel like Wolverine
Wake up in the morning, lips burning, can't move my spleen
See this lil' dude is mean, strapped up with tools and things
I'll get you different drugs mixed up like Smoothie King
The heavy platinum jewelry bling over the white tee
Watch your wifey, she's mostly likely to blow me pipey
I'm so exciting
Money, murder, steal, kill, rape
You should do like the Internet and start to Bill Gates
This whole world gon' end up with some bad fucking tumors, listening to these Cash Money rumors
I'll blast, bust, and shoot you, hit your block without the mask, fucking screw you
Treat you like a bitch, bitch look at me while I do you

Ok, ok, homie, ok
Peep it out, Squiddad
Let me catch my breath, let the Danger track roll
And let me holla at you, now let me holla at you, check it out
S-Q-A-D

Don't fool with any niggas like me
We pull triggers like weeds
Swigger off the Pi?a Colada
Dreams of having cream and the power
You need a problem? I'm the meanest to start with
And got grams the size of the head of Gina on Martin
For any discomfort the Ninas is sparking
Be in your apartment, many assault men and semi-revolvers
Keep it clean, I'm a young Sqad street teen, only into green
If you intervene I'll leave your ass colder than Winter
And y'all just look like bitches
You get fucked then I nut up
And just like bitches, I leave you face down and butt up
Nigga what up? I just bought a record to say fuck Hip-Hop
I spit it for them niggas who grip Glocks
Dip cops, flip rocks, and when the bricks drop
We fix blocks, suddenly watch the income

I'm the alleged convict in any Sqad incident
Last name Carter like Vince and shit

Cadillac white walls and 'Bauds, pimpin' partna
Plus I can get more work out than a fitness doctor
Let's get this partna, I'm the young don these niggas honor
And those of you who ain't cheap can't buy a vowel

Libel to find my condom inside of dry vagina

A minor with intentions to harm ya, holla

And you might get served if it?s proper enough
Or find your nerves on the curb if you a cop or something
A baller blocker or something, I'll send your noggin a hundred
Have the whole block sprinting, dashing, jogging, and running
Type of life I live, Gotti would love it
Sqad property buddy, some young niggas with a mafia budget
Can't nobody put nobody above it
And if they do, they find they body with your body above it
Fuck it, let's take it public, nah leave it the gutter

Try me and I send shots, leave they chest poking out they shirt
Yes, expect the worse when you fuck with the Squad right

Properly under my seat is where the heat at
Directly in your head is where the bullets meet at

My real father is a ho, my attitude is fuck pops
I'm living it up in a nice home, riding in trucks, tough drops
And I'm a young nigga, I don't even know how to do the bus stop
But I got my money right
When I hit the club, make it a sunny night
See the fake flossers, bum ballers, is a funny sight
Watching dudes front for these hoes in they Chevy right?
Pull up next to 'em in a 500 bumpin' Betty Wright
Keep my shit spaghetti tight
Playboy put the hood on that
We buy sports cars and put the fuckin' hood on that

Fee Fee Favorite

Flippin' in a whippa
Peel the top back like a zipper
Skippin' on them chrome dip slippers
Rippin' on the lips of a stripper
If that's your bitch mister don't kiss her
If so you might as well kiss a pistol
Cause all I do is shoot off in her whistler
She finna get my name on her shitter

So all I'm feeling is air on my head
With some ho that you might know, she sucking all the air out my head
Meet you close to knock you square out your head
Sip the Cris? to clear out my head and try to get my loot up
In Cuba with a translator ?? coke newer

Any beefs involving homie, your momma

Spark and shower, we get more stupid than Austin Powers
Smell the aroma of marijuana, Coronas when upon us
We do just what the neighborhood have shown us
We murder opponents and don't think about it, forget about it
Niggas won't do shit about it
Wave the pistol, get the bitch up out 'em
I'm off the hinges, chicks on my dick, proper than Cindy Crawford
Any problems I pop the chopper and knock the appendix out him
Hit the block with bricks of powder
What you know 'bout doing that?
And splitting a key with flour, making it two in fact
Dawg I'm all street, if you want Hip-Hop, here's what I give you instead

I wish them niggas who ain't got shit would stop hating on niggas who got shit
And you know I wish for Pun, Biggie, and Pac shit

When I see Lauren, I wish I knew why my heart burns
Wish 22 inch rims wouldn't rub on sharp turns

And dropped the whip on dubs and dipped in Bubble
Get a bad bitch to hustle and move product
And split them niggas quick as fuck if them dudes try her
Not behind the ho, but only behind the dough
And behind the dough I kill whoever stand behind the door
You ain?t tryna go that route with the Sqad, it?s rough, I promise
We kidnap your mommas and sit our johnsons on her tonsils
We reside inside the S. Q. bombers
And we leave families emotional like Carl Thomas
So stay from ?round us

Take heed to the shit that gleam on the left side of my waist

I?m hanging out the Hummer with Sos?
Exploding missile Glock ringing at the front of your door like Jehovah Witness?
Sober? Forget it
This C. M. B. thing, I?m over committed
The youngest soldier come with it
Cock back, guns put holes in your fitted
Nigga I told you to quit it
I load it with 50
I blow ?til it?s empty
The dro and Henny got me lokin? and limpin?
Ropin? up when I drink ?til I?m over the limit
Hoppin? out the Rover with Semis
Wildin? out, go straight to your momma?s house
With a rag on my face with more 9s than dialing out
Now who hating?
Niggas cheapskating, underestimating
The heat take him, put him under extra pavement
Some one week in Jamaica, come back with a accent like -

Whoo, whoo, fuck it
That?s 10000 bars for y?all bitches
Holla at me

DTP nigga!

I started with ten mack tens
And ten clips and ten pens
Got ten times richer in the span of ten years
Bitch I'm ten times two on a scale of one to ten
I'll battle ten crews with the strength of ten men

At nine, I was into crime, sex, and drugs
Pushin' an '89 Box Chevy sittin' on dubs
Nine thugs all ski masks, black suited with gloves
Break the imprinted chest with at least nine slugs

Man I ate eight clips with eight chicks
Watching eight flicks
You's 8-6 if you ate pussy with fake lips
I figure eight when my mind goes in circles
DID I DO THAT or was it Mystikal and Urkel?

On to 7 Ak 47, so what?
I got seven hoes stoppin' by at seven to fuck
Then put seven in your chest seven days a week
And add a foot for good measure you'll be seven feet deep

It goes 10-9-8-7-6-5-4
3-2-murder 1 lyrics at your door
These DTP niggas come ready for war
So don't start the fucking game
If you won't settle the score

I got six hoes distributing on six blocks
It's blistering from cops tryna stop these rocks from distributing
Six gun shots left
One pint of Vodka before this pimp will hit
It's street justice, now it's six hole in your casket

Give me a high five and I'll put that nine lower than your esophagus
Then smack you so hard that you have to come with 2Pacalypse
Five stars, twenty rims, five cars
I'd add more but I had to subtract one from five bars

I got four forty-fours on a rip on the floor
For you niggas talkin' shit
I'm fixin' to show you what for
I did four months in the bing instead of a hearse
Now it's DTP for life, dog for better or worse

I fuck three best friends
Ran on all three the same game
In these streets I'm a murderer
I got three alias names
I'm three times insane
Three shots will cave your brain
On 3 fire and ready, cock back and aim

It goes 10-9-8-7-6-5-4
3-2-murder 1 lyrics at your door
These DTP niggas come ready for war
So don't start the fucking game
If you won't settle the score

I'm packing two twenty-twos and twice the ammunition
But at Friday the 13th
What's up now superstition?
I'm a two timer with a couple of twins
Double jeopardy
With a pair of two deuces in the two seater Benz

I got one motto get dough till your gone
I got one main lady the rest of y'all is hoes
I'm numero uno with one more before I go
If you think I ain't the one bitch you too slow

And all you zero ass niggas ain't nothin' to me
Because I chop up O's, move dro', and chop keys
0-6 is my clique along with PC
Pretty Rick, Calil, V-Slim and Shondrez

It goes 1 to 10 and 10 to 1
Ludacris, Fate Feeze, and that nigga I-Twun
It goes 1 to 10 and 10 to 1
Ludacris, Fate Feeze, and that nigga I-Twun
It goes 10-9-8-7-6-5-4
3-2-murder 1 lyrics at your door

With a bank account that most niggas would kill for
Stupid retarded crib, and all my whips clean
Rocking some Jays that don?t come out 'til 2015
I?m moonwalking bitch, yeah I?m Michael Jackson Thriller fresh
Slipped inside the Mirror, saw a pimp nigga in the flesh
Spray some Polo cologne, to match my Polo socks
Now Coke bottle bitches, make your soda pop
And drop it like I ain't ever seen you drop it before ho
Drop it for a legend or this DTP logo
Drop it for a little free marketing and promo
And let me Instagram this photo

Scrolling through my Ho-lodex ""eeny meeny miny moe"", let?s see what hoe is next
So many to choose from, I can?t make up my mind
But whoever I pick better get up on the dick real quick, don?t waste my time
'Cause I got shit to do, so I?m just bout to smash
Soon as I?m through with you, back to counting this cash
I?m hung low to all these women, I?m their antidote
And when they on my dick look like they riding a banana boat
But on they period, I don?t want them mislead
So it?s a sign by my bed that say ?No turn on red?
Treating women like spades, I?m so unstoppable
Just tying to leave the club with 'bout 3 and I?m possible

9 time out of 10 I?m probably fucking with some hoes
At the strip club playing ""eeny meeny miny moe""
Walk in side the booty club, I?m picking any one I want
9 times out of 10 I?m probably fucking with some hoes like

Got a neck full of gold, fresh out the 'lympics (bling)
Stack never fold, pussy clap on the pole

Coming fresh out the corner now he on that hill

40,KRS-One,1st Quarter - The Commentary,I Got Next,"Welcome to hip-hop culture
Where DJ-ing, MC-ing, graffiti art, breaking
And the philosophies are expressed everyday
Within the inner cities of America, and the world
You are not doing hip-hop;
You ARE hip-hop
Love yourself and your expression; you can't go wrong"
41,KRS-One,2nd Quarter - Free Throws,I Got Next,"Anybody in here right now with tape decks turn em on
And put em on record, I'll give you a second
I want to add authenticity to your tape
So when it's sold out in the street
You all can know this was a real party
These are poems circulating throughout the nation
Everybody's bad and everybody's tough
But how many people are intelligent enough
To open up their eyes and see through the lies
Discipline themselves, yourself to stay alive
Not many
That's why the universe sent me today on this stage
With this to to say
The rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer
And in the final hour many heads will lose power
What does the rich versus the poor really mean?
Psychologically it means you got to pick your team
When someone says the rich gets richer
Visualize wealth and put yourselves in the picture
The rich get richer, cause they work towards rich
The poor get poorer, cause their minds can't switch from the ghetto
Let go, it's not a novelty
You could love your neighborhood without loving poverty
Follow me, every mother, father, son, daughter
There's no reason to fear the New World Order
We must order the whole new world to pay us
The New World Order and the old state chaos
The Big Brother watching over you, is a lie you see
Hip-Hop could build it's own secret society
But first you and I got to unify
Stop the negativity and control our creativity
The rich is getting richer, so why we ain't richer?
Could it be we still thinking like niggas?
Educate yourselves, make your world view bigger
Visualize wealth and put yourselves in the picture!"

I own that crown for lyrical
Combat
Spit more raps to count more stacks
Kickin back in the coup
I got loops relax, I'm hotness
Monotonous fans is runnin bizzack
L please don't leave the game like thizzat
Never in a million years
L'll never let you down baby
I drop 50, I steal gravy

I look back on Venus
I look (I look) back on Mars
And (and) I burn with the fire
Of ten (of ten) million stars (guess who's back, uh)

I'm more then a conqueror
Double up your bets
Come and rumble with the decks
I know you had that clown picked
Mind blowin out cos L still sound sick
You dream you was me
I gleam lyrically
I love 'em for it it's the highest form of flattery
Doin' the buck 10 chrome skating on the battery
My, clutch burnin' on top of the world turnin'
Rippers is just learnin by stacks I been earnin'
I'm the uncle L, future of the funk
Turn my joint up, find out why I'm different from all these chumps
And tell your favourite rapper that I'm ready to dump
For real cat, that represented rap from the jump


Six figure interest on the cheddar
From music, fashion, film and televison
Poppin amaretto, so what'chu got a vendetta?
I never felt better
Now forever competition get severed by skills you can't measure
I'm a champ, you a peon
Kiss the ring, begone
Known and respected on any block you be on
And be on, stand there, get your md on
I chuckle 'cos there's nuthin' to waste energy on
There you have it
The uncut raw for rap addicts
Waited three years to see if L still had it
Ten million stars
Got beef to the death
End of my contract, I'm the last one left!


L worth paper
Ask Def Jam who put em up in that skyscraper
(Yeah, I take them seriously baby)
Ask my dogs up in old five, who made a major?
LL playa
Now who's next to need a paper, drop a bomb on em

Devastate, and dominate

Give me the {pussy} and the money and the mic and I'm straight
Go to a restaurant, give me steak
Then cook my chicken with Shake'n'Bake

How much money can one black man make? Huh
I'm what's known as a true dynamiter
I write rhymes fast without a typewriter
Go with the flow, but no, I'm not a biter
Can't compare a cock-a-roach and a spider
Hell, you might as well get a glass of punch
Cause you're bitin my lyrics like a Nestle Crunch, huh
And bitin my rhymes ain't slick
I got your gold teeth marks all over my dick
Complications and aggravation
An unnecessary-sation
I'm like Sunkist, good vibrations

Cool out, grab a seat and listen..
Cause I'mma start dismissin
Sucker MC's who's out there frontin

I tell you what, give up the fanny
Cause on a bedroom tune, J's swift
Not too big, but nothin to play with
In addition, you on a mission
You need to audition for another position
Doin damage is a crew tradition
Name your next al-blum intermission
You're full of preservatives -- plus
You're too conservative
I'm full of flair, savoir faire, debonairre
There's no competition for this here
So don't waste your time and breath
I'm givin you all a big F

Yo I'm fat like the old Cray-on, smooth as Rayon
L is who the ladies stay on, baby play on
I stay jeweled up, pockets swelled up from banks I held up
Plenty bitch-ass niggas Big L stuck
I never catch cold feet when I hold heat
We roll deep, with the Triple Black dogs in their old jeep
I catch a fag three o'clock in the morn
On the block all alone and put the Glock to his dome
Tell him ""Give it up quick, you nitwit, don't try to get slick
Or I'm a let this four-fifth spit and leave your shit split""
Prick, it ain't nothing decent about me
A true thug for real, you can ask the precinct about me
A rap junkie, don't try to play me like some flunky
Jewels be chunky, pockets lumpy, attitude grumpy
And mad niggas be fronting the life
Popping mad shit, trying to be something they not
Your faggot ass better stay to dancing, don't even look at me
I might break your jaw just for glancing
I'm sick like Manson
In '97 Harlem kids is blowing
And we don't trip, we'll let a bitch starve til her ribs are showing

(Big L)
Word, check it out check it out check it out
Bust it
Emcee's get taught a lesson
When the mic is in my posession
Rap's my profession L is nice, no question
It's a fact I stay geared it shouldn't be weird
That I'm feared cause my raps are rougher
Than a nappy beard
I cook rappers like a chef
I'm def like Jeff right to left
My raps are better than mornin' breath
With niggas deaths I'm the number one suspect
Cause I catch much wreck specially when I'm upset
Suckers I'm a stiggedy star, breakin' 'em up and then takin' they heart
You better believe Big L is the man that be rippin' the microphones apart
I hold the forty right because I'm the naughty type
When I strike the mic niggas be like shorty hype
I'm smoother than Velvet my lyrics is well writ'
You sayin' L's this and L's get off L's dick
Rhymes I create and knock out ya gold tooth
Battlin' me is like fightin' a gorilla in a phone booth
I wreck mics and rock the cool speeches
Cause nowadays rappers think they motherfuckin' schoolteachers
One two, one two, rappers I run through
Fuck Karate I practice gun-fu
The Big L is an assasinator
I grab the mag and leave a fag leakin' like activator
I'm the nigga that you never even thougth of beatin'
Black white or puerto rican
I'm gonna slaughter each an'
Every crab emcee that runs up
When a battle comes up
Give me two thumbs up
Peace!"
49,Big L,560 Tape Freestyle,,"I walk through the ruggedest blocks
With jewels flooded with rocks
Hustlin' on hot corners that be smuggled with cops
I must warn, my Harlem crew roll strong
Word bond, we leave mics torn,y'all niggas slept too long now it's on
L Corleone'll never flop, rap style's forever hot
Front on me you better not, I keep the Baretta cocked
I got more papers than a New York Post
Packin' toast, this host is quick to roast a mic then I'm ghost
I'm not a soprano like that Italiano Sammy Gravano
MCs is gettin' knocked off like Paulie Castellano
This little menace be, guzzlin' Hennessy
Props from here to Tennessee, police wanna finish me
I run with cliques, pushin' luxury whips
Who be callin' chicks on Motorola flips, with illegal chips
Don't sleep troop, it's a fact I keep loot
Dime bitches be all over Big L like a cheap suit
The rap veteran, hot beats is the medicine
Niggas'll never win, in a battle, cause I'm better than
Ninety percent o' them, front and death'll be your minimum
The grave is where I'm sendin' 'em, clowns, like Mack 10 and 'em, uh!
I'm from the East Coast, this is how we roll in New York
A bunch of rowdy niggas holdin' the fort
Jackin' creeps, packin' heat
These Harlem streets is for keeps
Much love to all my peeps who got covered with sheets
And uh, where I be dwellin' at snitches get killed
On the real side, I probably fucked more bitches than Wilt, nigga
In clown hearts I put a lotta fear
One love to Fat Joe and 560 yeah, I'm outta here
Yo McGruff, yo my mellow, my man
Ayo uh, grab the mic and do the best ya can..."

When I take it out the box, I represent Lox
Now when I flow, you hit the rewind button
So I charge out more, want it all at the door
Fuck heat, Sheek walk around with an oven
Who you gonna kill with that little Foreman grill?
How it's gon' look when I come through your block?
Sheek, Funk Doc, Meth on top
Porsche, 300 horse fly by, back open pumpin How High (How High)
Yeah, can y'all see that (See that)
Bitch you can call me what you want, ''cause I'll Be Dat (Be Dat)

I'ma spell my name out on the side of your car

Come and Ruff Ryde with us
If you wanna get high with us

Come on nooooowwwww

I got a twin cam exhaust connected to the jaw
A five speed clutch on my paw when I ride
I glow like the pegs in Lite-Brite
3000 bolts of lightening when fly the right kite
Me and Meth be hennesey, two ice cubes
We can draw (Choose your weapons) or do I choose?
When I choose the grip, one shot lose your hip
I hope your shoes fit for this move and pick
My avalanche it came with, ten feet of snow
I'm cold blooded, my fam half eskimo
My flows move like endo
Turn ten nickels into ten loads, outta ten stoves
Ride the crash course, do the math on it
Swizz Beats you can ride Amtrak on it
But I'm on it, grillin with George Foreman
Ya peeps is at the Grammy awards cornin
The ice, the fat wallet son, I won it
In the helicopter, warmin before morning
Def Jam nigga, Redman nigga, Doc
Fuck ya momma on my sweat band nigga
You tough guys will get smacked in the club
With the gun I bought from Mack in the club
Its P-P-P from Bricks to Brook-nam (Come on)
Bring me some more ass to whoop on
Chorus

Look what the cat dragged in
Underground dweller from the cellar bring terror
Scoop of high yellow cinderella, Meth forever
Never rush a rhyme, hook could never bust my nine
But if I have to, I have to, it's all in the mind
I stay ahead of time while y'all fallin behind
Tryin to relight ya lime, it's a crime when I drop ??? design
That tick it, tick boom, blow your mind
Yeah me, M-E-T, H, the O, the D
Can't be done like tryin to find a penny in the sea
Nigga run for cover son go and get them guns
Y'all ain't from here, don't try to come around and gettin ones
Swizz Beat the track in the head, but I instead
Pull my ?dart gun? and bust sixteen until it's dead
I'm the game, all of my dogs be off the chain
Yellin Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang

-Daddy, Daddy! Would you please tell me a story?
-Alright, get over here and sit yo' big ass down
Lemme tell you about the Sooperman Lover...

Ayo, I was out to lunch and shit, puffin' on a blunt to get my head wrecked
Boogie'n to my Walkman with an ""S"" on my chest
(Bust a move!) Yes, I'm a superhero, don't forget
I smoke mad niggas so to hell with cigarettes
But anyway, let's get back to this skit
You know who the fuck I am, so git off that ol' bull-
Shucks! Lunchtime was up?FUCK!
Let me jet, or I'll collect unemployment bucks
On the way back, Jack, I spotted this object, a stray cat
Stuck in a tree, with a tag that says that:
""If found, please return to this address""
(How did you see it?) Nigga, with my X-ray eye set!
Like ""Pchoooooooww"", I jetted to the closest phone-booth
Quick flash, I dipped into my Sooperlover suit...
(Johnny 'Guitar' Watson: I can leap tall buildings...yeah...
In a single bound...)
Boom! Right through the fuckin' phone booth ceiling
(It's a, it's a plane!) Nah, Sooperman Lover's the name
I can slam King Kong and pick up freight trains
On a mission, to save this cat that was wishin'
He was in his litter, watchin' Fritz on channel 6'n
Relaxin', feet cocked up, just a little
With a cod cocktail and a bowl of tender vittles
I snatched him, took off through the air like a pigeon
Quick so he won't start meowin' and bitchin'
Then landed at the cat's tag address in the projects
(Elevator's broken!) So I had to take the back steps
(Knock, Knock) The door opened then my eyes swole
From this badass honey sippin' a quart of Old Gold
""Yo, is this your cat?"" ""Awww, yes! Where'd you find him at?""
""He was stuck in a tree up by uptown Manhattan""
""Well, how the hell did you save him? Are you police undercover?""
""Naw baby the ""S"" on my chest stands for""

Sooperman Lover, yeah
Said they call me the Sooperman Lover, yeah
But something wrong...
There's something wrong with me
There's something wrong, yeah, yes it is...

She was grateful, lookin' for ways to repay me
No money, a donut, and some..uhm coffee maybe?
""Of course, what kind to show that I thank ya?""
""Make my donut jelly, and my coffee Sanka""
We sat, unhooked the cape from my back
She felt my arms 'cause my pythons looked stacked
""Goddamn, Sooperlover! Yo shit look thick
Tell me, how strong are you with muscles like this?
You bad motherfucker!"" (I'm stronger than a locomotive)
Akhi hit ya like Rocky
She dashed to the room and came back with an ounce
Negligee, high-heeled shoes with a blunt in her mouth
Ready to roll up, hey hold up, she had the dollar fold up
To mix the coke with the smoke, yo, she was no joke
She took a sniff, some got on her top lip
That bitch stuck out her tongue and gave her top lip a lick
And said: ""Here baby, hit it."" ""Naw baby, I ain't wit' it
You'd need more than a body to make me wanna sniff that shit!""
But I'll hit the blunt, so she took out her fronts
Cracked the Phillie, opened the bag, and laid out the skunk
Then I took a long pull, it was hype, oughta sight
She ran into the bedroom so I cracked my pants for head room
Later, tossed the cover and, oh brother, I was wit' it
Ready to hit it asked my dick (Yo, wassup, G?)
Yo, man, shit's thick
Licked her on her belly then kissed her on her back
Stuck my hands between the legs and I felt the bozack
As big as mine (Ewwww!) This bitch must be craze
So I threw my suit on and I was Swayze...
'Cause I'm the

Sooperman Lover, yeah
Said they call me the Sooperman Lover, yeah

Blowing dro on 24's
That's how all my niggas roll

I'm in a drop-top Chevy with the roof wide open
My partners looking at me to see if my eyes open
Cause I've been dranking and I've been smoking
Flying down 285 but I'm focused
454 SS, I race Porsches
White leather seats, as fresh as Air Forces
Doing 'bout a hundred but the track still bumping
Number 8 on N.W.A, ""Straight Outta Compton""
Pull up at your apartment sitting on 20 somethings
And the dope boys hollering ""What's happening?"" kid running in
The cliques start dancing and the broads start choosing
And the cars been parked but the rims keep moving
Sign pictures, buy an onion of good and throw the deuces
Cause I ain't Hollywood, I come from the hood, I'm used to it
If your rear view shaking and your seats vibrating
24 inch Dayton's got the Chevrolet skatin' makin'


I make a million and I'm satisfied, I'll get the rest
Underaged civilian in the tigthest ride, I want the best
I refuse to get a 9 to 5, I'mma flip my keys
Been paying my dues since '89, tryna get my cheese
Diamonds gleam when I'm on the scene, they know it's me
Ain't no dream or no fantasy bitch, it's T-I-P
Broad busting, like a baby do a binky
Five karat DVS's on my mothafuckin' pinkie
Half of Hennessy and Belvedere's what we dranking
Pimp squad send for broads, what the hell you niggas thinking?
Young nigga spending weekends on the islands in the fall
24 inch rim shining when I'm riding cause I'm balling
I'm calling out shots like a pool shark
My tools spark in the dark when I fool marks
Y'all fools hearts in the wrong place at the wrong time, I got a strong mind
To grab my chrome nine and shoot at your ass for a long time
But I'mma get that ass hauled off, fuck around with the clique
They'll be looking for your dick with a stick, nigga y'all soft
So y'all lost, I'mma ball out at all costs, spit game to a dame
Make her ride on this thang 'til she falls off and sucks balls off, I got the


I'm not boucing little shorty, I'm relaxing right now
I'd probably still be trapping if I wasn't rapping right now
Bragging about pistols at the house, guess who's strapped right now
Keep on talking folk, I'll lay you on your back right now
Want to act right now, get smacked right now
I'm a buck mothafucka, I don't know how to back down
Clown down here fakin', frontin', talking ?bout what you making: nothin?
I'm 21 and 10 years deep, that shit to me ain't nothing
I'm raised by the niggas getting head from the jays
Lose your leg when I spray, end up dead from the K
Stay ready for the raid, paid heavy from the yay'

On the streets of Memphis we bumpin'

Still slangin', serving raw

And we won't stop
We always knew we'd make it
Even though you player hated
We still made it to the top

Puerto Rock Puro, not Menudo no I'm not the one
I'm studyin' Judo, you don't know if I got a gun
It's Pun, from the X side of things, baguette inside my rings
Everything I want I gets, bada-BING
It's mine I Shyne like money that sound like Biggie
Fuck around my town, Boogie Down my city
Come around get pound, to the ground no pity
Watch the sound, fo'-pound twenty round milli'
Get smacked silly, for coming out your mug
I'm known for bouncin' thugs from the Tunnel to the Salsa clubs
Don't matter, put the chrome to your bladder
Splatter your abs, have you pissin' in a plastic bag
That's a drag now you abnormal
Don't make me go out to rumble
And put some motherfuckin' stabs on you
The night is young and I'm already fightin', hidin' my gun
Promoter buggin' screamin', who the fuck invited Pun


From San Juan to Bayamon, I'm the Don Juan beside the Don
Live long, get your party on
Don't let the liquor fool you, cause I'll stick it to you
Somethin sharp to the heart, or somethin big to move you
The Desert or the shottie, whatever you the body
That chose to be the dumb nigga at the party
Too much Bacardi started speakin' dumb
Then you tried to snuff Joe, must have been Puerto Rican rum
That's the hardcore, two years a sophomore
Takes years to earn a pair of Terror Squad balls
So get lost or take one, bones I break them
Pigs are bacon, so get fried if they come
You see that? I'm like G. Rap, 'Pac, Master P
All balled up with a twist of Marc Anthony
Recognize me I'm the one that's cockin' the auto
Tony Sunshine please canten el coro

 It ain't over
 I thought you ain't like the beat
 Te digo que no se ha acabado

La tierra del Borinquen donde nacido yo

Almost and there's no need to raise our voices

On a boat lift the covers and I pet her ass
Never know when I gotta go cause my life is impossible
The way I'm livin' the good things never last
So I live for the minute just want to start to begin it
When I wake up again I'm on stage rockin'
20,000 people they yellin' feedin' my ego
When it's over the groupies they wanna know what's poppin'
Double-O Nina, known for dippin'
From place to place I gotta vacate the mission
Gotta get the money but what do you know I wake up
In a movie theater with my little ones on a big one
Hollywood movie with the Jackass cats
I close my eyes I open 'em and I'm back at rap
In the studio collabin' killin' wack ass crap
But then in a blink I wake up and pack that strap
In the club cause some other niggas want my head
I don't know too much about 'em but they won't buy red
I ain't trippin' don't wanna let the killers in blue start me
Wake up again I'm a DJ Clue party
With Diddy and Jim Jones, Juele and Rick Ross
Cat Fay, Trey Songz and Drake this is boss
Amazing, life's hella crazy
Livin' like I'm a quatro, triple, double agent

(Double-O Nina) Where I'm bout to go I don't even know
(Double-O Nina) In a place where almost anything goes
(Double-O Nina) Many roads when I travel is what I chose
(Double-O Nina) Where I'm living I really got to many roads

Me had a lot of women but them need me
Wake up tryin' to hide it but sin sees me
Overseas nigga tryin' to begin freaky
Wake up at the award at MTV, you
Then I stab it at you, wake up
I'm back at Missou and I get to mackin' a few
After the yak I take 'em back to the sack and I screw
Scat then back to the lab I got some rappin' to do
Then I wake up again I'm on stage at Paid Dues
This characteristic is made to slay crews
Some tryin' to get at me to battle but they lose
Then I'm wakin' up with my kids on a paid cruise
They callin' me daddy, wake up in a strip club
They callin' me daddy, man I'm goin' hella baddy
Amazing, life's hella crazy
Livin' like I'm a cuatro, triple, double agent


At any rate I'm all over the place
Music and being a father and I know that I made
Got me feelin' moon stricken but Nin' remain calm
Livin' like I'm out of a scene from James Bond
Switchin', changin', feelin', Strangin'
Livin' multiple lifes, robbin' and gangbangin'
Freakin' all over the world Middle West swangin'
Always on the move ain't never time for hangin'
Slick with my shit my grip don't fold
Pick the fly chicks and ditch those hoes
Kiss for my bitch my kids get dough
Ripping my scripts I hits this road

I?m saying, I?m trying to holler at you
I mean, what?s good?

You got all these girls over here
I?m not trying to be a groupie)
No, no no no no you?re not a groupie
A groupie comes for the whole group
You?re just here for me, you?re my 1zie

My 1zie, my 1zie
Know what she want, and she know where she wanna be
My 1zie, my 1zie
Girls all around me, but she?s the only one I see
Only in town for a night, my 1zie
So I know it makes you shy, my 1zie
Girl we grown, so come on
You?re nothing like a groupie, 'cause you?re my 1zie

I got a big tour bus baby won?t you come see?
Even though you know a lot of women want something from me
You don?t know me that well cause I?m hella underground like Bun-B
Such fun we could have, it'll be a blast if I could play with you like Jumanji
I?m hood and techie, that?s grungy
She?s good and preppy, Abercrombie
Pressing her would be sexy she's hailing from Montre-al
And when I say ?y'all? she laughing at me sounding country
She said she don?t do the groupie thing I?m grumpy
My face looking like Ashton Kutcher just punk?d me
It haunts me when a woman?s just with me
And I don?t get none because she's feeling groupie
But you?re just with me, so you?re my 1zie

Know what she want, and she know where she wanna be

Only in town for a night, my 1zie

Girl we grown, so come on
You?re nothing like a groupie, 'cause you?re my 1zie

They always care about what everybody think
Don?t wanna hook up with rappers on tour with scary body ink
Missing out on a good guy, that when I kiss ya very naughty pink
But some of them be those evil B.O. people, hairy, probably stink
But I ain?t talking about you, because you?re gorgeous
And I don?t wanna hear the groupie thing, it's just me baby don?t forfeit
Just come towards this, extend me like a swordfish
Ignore chicks who say you?re a big groupie, loosen up in gorged dick
How we kiss it lightly, don?t try to fight
These feelings that you?re feeling from this Kansas City iced tea
I shouted sugar honey ice tea!
You?re just with me and not the group
So you're a 1zie, groupie slights me

My 1zie, my 1zie
Know what she want, and she know where she wanna be
My 1zie, my 1zie
Girls all around me, but she?s the only one I see
Only in town for a night, my 1zie

Girl we grown, so come on

With me and the feelings we denying none
You maybe crying some cause it feels so good
And now I leave you lying sprung
Go tell your girls you did the humpty dumpy

Jumped off in it like a bungee, down under like I was Dundee
Don't say groupie baby girl you're just my 1zie

60,Lauryn Hill,1996 Freestyle,"J. Period Presents... Best of Lauryn Hill, Vol. 1: Fire ","Yo, this is the Refugees, gonna give you a little vibe of the score
As we bug out in this studio wit' my man, John Peel
You know how we do, bust it

How many mikes do we rip on the daily?
Say, me say, ""Many, many"", say, me say, ""Many, many, many""
How many mikes do we rip on the daily?
Many, many, say, me say, ""Many, many, many""

You crossed the line, now there's no comin' back
Emcees are gettin' sucked into my intergalactical pull
I'm the articles on you, on your ass
If you get the microphone, brother, you can just say:
'Pras asked me no questions and I'm tellin' you no lies'
If you're lookin' at me wrong, this wasn't meant for your eyes
Realize you can't knock this cause this style is 'noxious
It's gaseous, I'm turnin' all your rap pages to ashes
Oh, this thing's creative, debated it from here to Asia
Minor rhymers, find your vocabulary
Kind of ordinary, I get tossed up, it's scary
Maybe we're legendary, we roll blunts like Bob Marley
And you sittin' on for Sugarhill, they was a band
My man, learn your history before you try to sham
Oh, shimmy, don't go bar-frontin', jokers need to start
Led to the T-O-Ps where you find the Refugees
Three like Jamaicans say when they feelin' I-R-E
Ha-ha, so Wyclef, won't you touch it?"
61,Lauryn Hill,Adam Lives in Theory,MTV Unplugged 2.0,"Adam lives in theory
Trying to turn stone into bread
Masquerading like he got it figured out
Cut off from the sunshine, only smart in his own head
Leaving his descendants to hope and doubt
Left to his devices, those worthless sacrifices
Praying to the altar of himself
Making pilgrimages, thinking he's religious
Like he's got all the light, and no one else
He takes the unsuspected
Cause he knows they're not connected
And he shows them how to be just as he is
Virtually real, and commercially appealed
To the lust of all the people where he lives
Eve was so naive, blinded by the pride and greed
Wanting to be intellectual
Drifting from the way she got turned down one day
And now she thinks that she's bisexual
Caught up in emotion
Burning up in her devotion
To the king of exploitation in the field
She handed him her virtue
Cause he told her ""I won't hurt you""
So she lay with him to see how good it feels

Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now?
Where we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?
Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now?
Where we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?

Now after the sensation, and the empty fornication
She brought affection home
Into her bed, quickly multiplying
Now the 3 of them are dying by the poison she perceived to be good head
Now Eve and her husband are perverted in their judgment
Cause everything appears to be the same
They entertain suggestion
Next time just use protection
Desiring to cover up their shame
But much to their demise, poor decision closed their eyes
To the very antidote to their dilemma
Burning in their lust
Both of them adulterous
Destroying the original agenda
Praying to the sky, in order to maintain a lie
They exhausted every possible conclusion
They can't even entertain the solution
In a brain filled with vain information and pollution
Hiding from the truth
He provided an excuse to explain away his desperate situation
When confronted, blamed his wife
Giving birth to carnal life
Refusing to acknowledge what he done
Now if we can agree with who created us to be
Who says we're guilty everyone before his eyes
Making no exceptions, since the day of our conception
Predisposed to hating truth, and loving lies


Stop walking in pride, let the thief be crucified
Un-learn everything you know, and let Him teach you
Line upon line, and precept upon precept, say goodbye
To this decaying social system
He wants to know how far we're willing to go
If we love him like we say we do
He will try us
Just you don't regress
Or slip into hopelessness
Once He's satisfied His love
He won't deny us

And then He'll tell us, what, what we gonna do now?
Where we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?
And then He'll tell us, what, what we gonna do now?
Where we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?"
62,Scarface,11-09-2000,The Last of a Dying Breed,"Yeah, I'd like to, umm...
Take time out to tell everybody that been bumping my shit for the past thirteen years, that I love that man, I appreciate that
Every motherfucking body that was in my corner, comparing me to the greats, you know in the game, I appreciate that too man
Umm...
I've got too many motherfuckers to name, so I'll just say I appreciate y'all, y'hear?
Alright
I'm gone"
63,Scarface,2 Real,My Homies,"(Bun B)
I always wanted to be the biggest man in somethin
Had to find my place
But the world can leave a foul taste on the tongue
Had to dodge a case
Had to dodge a bullet
And the nigga that tried to pull it
The streets is throwed
If I don't get lean and blowed everyday
I feel just like I'mma explode on overload and overdrive
All my life this drive I tried
I seen a lot of good niggas die
Cause somebody hated somebody lied or somebody snitched
Or somebody's a bitch
I wish I could change the past
But I gots to live in the present and pray
That tomorrow this shit don't last, I'm livin to fast
Shit, my momma asked me who I was like she ain't know me
But, to tell the truth I didn't know myself
I found out she had to told me
Just to show me just how good I had it
I guess I couldn't see it
Mild-mannered I just couldn't be it
But that was just the way we used to G it
One of the wrongest niggas I see
Or one of the strongest niggas I know
Walkin on my tippy-toe cause the life I live ain't long and I know
So I put weed in the bong and I blow
Stay cool calm and collected a neglected
Child that grew into a man that's widely respected
Too real
(Chorus)
I feel no pain
I can't complain
Stuck in the game
Tryin to maintain
Cause I'm so real
(Pimp C)
We blow big everyday
But that don't stop our pain
Or bring back our homeboys that we done lost off in this dirty game
Got niggas doin 40
When you 25 that's life
I guess when your career is sellin dope somebody got to pay the price
These bitch ass niggas shife
Niggas might snitch out they momma
That's why me and Leroy watch stay strapped and ready for all drama
Cause we ain't promised tommorow
But nigga you promised to die
Nigga can't you see you gettin to high trippin of that potent fry
At night I talk to God and try to understand
How people can worship false prophets and say prayers to a man
I guess they already gone, ain't nothin gone bring them back
So I just say thanks for what I got and blow on indo sacks
I still love my piece and chain, wood grain and big head ones
But I had to realize in life everything ain't always fun
I guess that's true for some
But them hoes will never win
Out here just hustlin and grindin
Tryin to change from niggas to men
Chorus
(3-2)
My nigga you a ho to me
Boy you done went off on me
Runnin round with the fakin and hatin
I'mma blast if you run up on me
I'mma do my dirt by my lonely so that nobody can snitch
This matter coulda been resolved
If you woulda came clean and paid my shit
See niggas disrespect the game but boy you'll never last
Pullin that ho shit sellin your partner out for a piece of ass
And fool you claim you real but really need to be shot up
No respect for your family that's dead
Don't write yo peoples locked up
Damn I miss my dog he was hog to this game
Unlike bustas these days that talk down on your name
You boys is funny
I'm bout my money
And oh so true
Mr. 3-2 when I never trusted you
I'm too real

Style it out, throwin four thousand out
Swimsuit mammal get high, float flammable
Drop off in a Benz boat lampable
Rear like hittin a deer

No question all brolic guerillas stand up
Whoever large throw a hand up, throw a grand up
Let's like multiply connect both sides, big shit low rides glide
Everybody bump once
Yo Chef gonna throw ya'll niggas free lunch
Hit the L twice, need it once

Yo mystical,  rap Larry Davis with a pistol
And this you, you a student, fucking with a principal

Rollin like ten at a time, begin
Love revolves around a thin line, go against this, send mine
Lace you chase you down, let a hundred rounds race you
Now you went from brolic to a facial

Yo, ayo glass tree house
Yo, Fiendin like fuck in a green house
Rush and cut, chain cream out
Blow steam out
Rare like guccis in ears
Goose bears
Skied up, loving all my deustch years
Coat for broadway
Hundred and 39th all day
Got my chick rollin call her Parle'
20th century max like jail penitentiary
Nikki Barnes gon' lynch me
What, fruit flavored nikes
Benz 2000 the hype piece
Send half my love out to white peeps
Wu-Tang emblem, success, make a nigga tremble
Nine of us stand, nine resemble
Filling out tax reports
Look live up in Guess shorts
Bitches got love and support
Yo, leather jacket, yellow
Leather hat, mack it real mellow
New York state of mind, crime Othello
Wild zoo of bitches, burrow that's Staten

Pinch me, I bought head from Monica Lewinsky
Arrest that hoodlum

I need some of that, slide through the back
I need ya'll to come back to the, I heard juice
Back of the store over here, just be easy and tell ya man to be cool
We got some culinary cats right here, we need you we'll kill him if he fault

Aiyo, rappers steppin' to me, they want a brick son
But I'm the Chef, my price is twenty-six son
Move up, about thirty-two of those and open locker dough
Soldier got locked up, blow killed the doctor
Flamboyant police is X fives, watchin' my lofts
So many leeches I just left it and walked
My flow wicked, Miami money, movin' and ridicule
Geico on the arm froze, rose gold with me
Take baths with white women, lingerie see-through
Takin' trips to Iran, my Spanish nigga peoples
Sellin' drugs to Flatbush, call my nigga Cecil
Snub with the black gloves, on half-moon Greek do
Killed him in the Bahamas, his wife ran white van pulled up
They caught him out in Brooklyn with a white man
Slutted out, rosed out, sister was gone, she geekin'
She threw the rifle in her mouth and said good evenin'
Yup, Paul Wall grill line, be getting money, crime thief
I know her from Africa, pretty smile, nine teeth
Gold joints, frames only, Louis Vuitton, pony
Leather with the matching sweater on, you owe me

Knock the ash off the blunt, confront niggas who cunt
Swing an ax, tax niggas rhyme different from cats
Specialize in mic rippers, splashes
We the last skippers, big rocks and the block will stick

Beefsteak Charlie niggas eat and they get fat
Chase heads up and down the block and kill rats
Skilled with the gats, even feds don't know where the shells at
The shell trapped up in nice crib with four packs
Four macs, caught a nice sale for four stacks
Yeah, me and my nigga Arafat
Gotta escape but we'll be right back, real soon
Chef cook it up, we got a date with real goons
Telling you Ghost, my connect crazy with the wet
Might know him used to talk to his sister named Yvette
I speed it up, me and the Linx, was getting weeded up
I beat it up, yeah I hit that, but I ain't seed it up
Meanwhile, back on the block, we seen two trucks
Then the windows rolled down, we see these two fucks
Soon as they jumped out, see these tools bust


Yeah, yo, I lit a boogah up, rocks is gone, so we baggin' up all shape
Binoculars, scanners, we all listen to jake
Ran out of baggies, my mouth is dry
Got them dirty joints that scatter, don't act surprised
Nah, nigga the currency rushes like popping a wheelie
Holding a pipe with one hand, the other countin' the billies
You know how it be with the peppermint Clarks, throwing darts at a hoodrat
Getting slow neck up in The Bronx
That's all me, thirty four shines, forty four lines
I just chill like Aaron Hall, writin' raw rhymes
Like, threw Kool-Aid rubies in a lemonade bezzle
When I was twelve in the church, I started packin' that metal
A deuce-deuce, my supplier was Loose Bruce
Ever since I had the drop, my instinct was to shoot-shoot
This ain't For the Love of Ray J, it's for the love of the AK
Cuz you can get scratched like AJ
Cuban Link Dynasty has emerged, this rap shit stop
I have a team of niggas moving my furs"
66,Slick Rick,2 Way Street,The Art of Storytelling,"Well I shot some deer, then I copped some beer
And did a show up in West Bubblefuck somewhere
Due to raps wider ratio, satellites to Nato
Hillbilly drawers flew on the stage like tomatoes
Apparently more mack than I thought
Unfortunately wife piece back in New York
And I'm starvin
Being human and open with
A mad fine hillbilly woman was scoping Rick
Thought entered how to lean and bent it
Though I'm not gonna lie I was extremely tempted
(To what, Rick?) To discharge in a sista
Next thing in the dressing room, ""Pardon me, mister""
Yes, I said cautiously
""Crazy, but possibly
You could sign your name on the back of these Dazy Duke shorts for me""
Try to resist, now girlfriend startin' it
The pen won't write, ""You can press down hard on it"" -
Now my hand browsing her South end
Spun around about to shove my tongue in her mouth when
Rring! - Loosen the grip my hell had
My girl, she was talking so nice I felt bad
Being untrue, no telling what it might do to her
""I love you"", forced to say I love you back too to her
Any thought of getting pussy was doomed to:""You got a wife?""
Anniversary comin up soon too
Got off the phone, cock just got mute
Don't get me wrong it's not like you're not cute (Uh-huh)
I'm wrong for mistreating her, the wanting to skeeting her
""I understand, goodbye, it was real nice meetin' ya""
What an angel overcoming his wrongness
The moral I am trying to get across in this song is

If goodness is what you're filling your soul with
And wanna find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Who keeps no secret, like who they creep with
Realise early it's a 2 way street, kid (Say what?)
Goodness is what you're filling your soul with
And wanna find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Who keeps no secret, like who they creep with
Realise early it's a 2 way street, kid
Casually seating with some thick chords eating
With my album playing at a big board meeting
""I love this"", being the coolest and the ruffest
A big willie woman pulls the Ruler in her office
And fixed a wedge in her garment, unsteady my heart went
Cause her office looked like a three bedroom apartment -
Pounding was inevitable
She said to me ""Rick, I think your album is incredible""
The way the hon' upon I, comin' on a sun I
""You're so darn sexy with that patch over your one eye""
Well I'm glad you think it's boomin' and I catch ya
Means a lot to me, coming from a woman of your stature
I mean, who could resist the Don head?
Start caressing Rick private, kiss me on the neck
And I can't be held accountable if down her gown I pull
Girlfriend pussy look plump and poundable
She sweats the set me emporer
Put one of your legs up on the desk and let me enter ya
Fantastic, though I start to act drastic
When I see my wedding band 'pon the bitch left ass cheek
Deep down, she felt that I tried to diss
I'm like, I can't do this as much as I'd like to, miss
An angel overcoming his wrong, kids
The point that I am trying to get across in this song is"
67,Slick Rick,Adults Only,The Art of Storytelling,"Check (5X)
Well, let us skip the boring foreplay I'm slidin' right in
This girl over my house who had to be about 19
Ass, hoes in my poster
She's sweatin' although she tried to hold her composure
I hoped she'd take it in the ass and suck dick
(Girl) My my what a nice apartment you got Rick
On her knees about to make her fall
(Girl) ""All platinum and gold jammies hangin' on the wall too
You got it goin' on""
Now my mouth start foamin'
The lights dim we're kissin' and my hands start roamin' in her drawers
(Girl) Stop!
Knew she was joking
Cause I ain't even fuck her and her pussy was soaking WET!
Already had her tit out
If I play my cards right, fuck her dig in the hole she shit out
(Girl) Rick I gotta go my girls waitin'
She recaps finally when honey drawers down to her kneecaps
Breathed heavy all mushy bitch
Swore up and down I was gonna fuck her in the pussy
Since friends waitin' on subtle
Bout time to make a move upon the hungry little butthole
Meanwhile she acted quite passive
Lickin' the hun neck while she lotionin' that ass with jelly
Tit hung out the frame nigga loco
Surprised honey didn't put up too much of a struggle, at first
Sinkin' in she ain't know how to be the bitch went
(Girl) ahh Rick it hurts take it out of me!
Knocked my magazine down, bitch threw my papers
You wanna keep it down I mean I do have neighbors!
Squirmin' away although the table was barrin' her
Felt real good my dick was sunk so far in her
She said it felt like a bulldozer boring her
Sqealing about she couldn't take it anymore in her
My cummed on her straight in the perm in her, (here)
As I drained every last drop of sperm in her (where)
Chorus:
So girls when we kiss and we cuddle, ain't no way to put it subtle
When I want the butt hole!
(Moaning in back round)
Another girl I met, her experience vast because
Most girls with kids done been hit in their ass before
Picked her up sunset
(Girl) Don't be late for dinner, ma
Bringing honey home from the date at the cinema
Thinking how to fuck the ass so plottin'
Blown in the elevator, hit the stop button
She smiled, by knowing her butt I wanna bore
I said ""Can I have a kiss now instead of in front of your front door""
(kissing/sex in the back round) (Uhhhmmm!! Oh yeah!)
Although The Ruler tried not to push hard
I'm all over the bitch like an octopus
Deep down I know she also wanna fuck
Though I kept my tongue in her mouth so not to put her on the spot
To have to talk no shit to prevent me from bonin'
Unzap the bra, when the hooker start moanin and
Expose my espresso suck on her and lick on her
Unbucklin' pulling out mad long dick on her
Panties in the way of that, but I want to check it out
Slipped her wet drawers down her thigh and took her leg out
Her butt was juicy kinda fat
Spun around start to stick her in the pussy from the back
She came, mad juice dripped out
Still in the pussy then acted like it slipped out
Cum on the floor, She said ""Pardon the puddle""
Spread open her cheeks, pushed hard in her butt hole
Uhhhmmm, wasn't a bad date at all, she went AHHHH AHHHH
Start pullin' at my balls while I'm still penetratin'
Felt fantastic, she said
(Girl) ""Rick I'm not really into this ass kick""
Meanwhile Rick cummin' by the gallon
Put your hands on the wall please
And try and keep your balance
Lickin' the grill in her, meanwhile fillin' her
Till sperm start pourin' out her butt hole while I'm still in her
Then start rammin' the pine in her
I almost picked her up with these final grinds in her
Chorus:
So girls when we kiss and we cuddle
Ain't no way to put it subtle when I want the butthole!
(Moaning)
Girl: My ass, more, more, more!"

(Cardo got wings)
Real nigga shit
Other night at your crib, it was like me, Black, 40, OB
We just sittin' there, talkin' 'bout life
Played some beats, but I forgot to tell you one thing

Niggas called me to set you up
Want me to come and wet you up
Cause you a out of town nigga like Biggie
Heard about the shit with Diddy
So I came through to vest you up
And I got a vest for 40, a vest for Hush
A vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what
I got L.A. unified
You better off committin' suicide, teachers ain't testin' us
See, I know how it feel to be platinum-plus
Niggas is jealous of you, so they try to wrap you up
Tax you up, but it's OVO/Blood Money
Nigga catch these bullets like he catch the bus
Dawg, fame is a motherfucker
Do a nigga four favors when you can?t do the fifth
How soon they forget?
Run up on you at your granny house, give you nine like Fif'
How a nigga s'posed to love you niggas?
Heart beatin' fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas
Dre told me not to trust you niggas
Your energy off, you're finicky, I rush you niggas
Just walkin' 'round the crib like, ""Why a nigga can?t live?""
Get this money, fuck these bitches though
Thinkin' 'bout the beef like:
""We can pass these mothafuckin' straps like a physical""
This my city, nigga, everybody know it
Ridin' 'round town, just me and my Four Pound
Tucked in my Tom Fords, hopin' I ain't gotta show it
L.A. niggas, be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit, 40, I'm fucked up

Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do with me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hundred
L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hundred
L.A., all I ever asked is one hundred
L.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hundred
All I ever asked is one hundred

Thank me later, thanks for nothin', thanks for bluffin'
Thank you so, so much for wearin' your true colors
To every single fuckin' function
Had niggas tell me to my face how we were family
And how they love me while they were skimmin' off the budget
Now, when I see 'em, they're the ones that's actin' funny
People been reachin' out to me
And I'm on some straight unresponsive shit
I would have so many friends
If I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments
I would have so many friends
If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans if I didn't go pop and I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
I'm in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get
Yeah, nobody's even hearin' it, on top of the pyramid
Might go to Jamaica, disappear again
My circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself...

Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do with me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hundred
L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hundred

L.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hundred
All I ever asked is one hundred

Miss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga
Held a nigga down since he was a lil' nigga
If he was still alive, he would kill niggas
He was Lil Snupe, I was Meek Mill
Niggas know how it feel when you missin' your nigga though
Can't think, so you roll up that indigo
Stressin' while drivin' down Figuero'
Blowin' kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost, damn
Make a real nigga wanna give his life to God like, ""Here it go""
Screamin' Frog name at the clouds, they don't hear me though
Guess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though
You niggas don't feel me though
That was on Suge's watch, I'll take Suge's watch
You dissin' Drizzy, that's cool, but don't come to my city though
Not even to H-Town
So underground that I gotta be a trill nigga
Strapped up from the waist down
That's word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga
Shit was so simple when Henchman was out
He had a young nigga right there with Meech
So happy when Bleu Davinci got out
We came up on these California streets
L.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Got a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?
Don't even matter, dawg, cause I'm a always be a real nigga
Always be a real nigga
I never learned how to be nothin' but a real nigga

Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do with me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hundred
L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hundred
L.A., all I ever asked is one hundred
L.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hundred
All I ever asked is one hundred"
69,The Game,100 Bars and Runnin,,"Who be, standing on Compton Blvd. in them Gucci's
Drinking a 40, it's me, the nigga with the uzi
Standing by the new 6 with creamy white rocks
White Tee, Dickies and a black fitted White Sox
This ain't Chi-Town but we got a windy city
Cause every bitch and fiend in Compton blow
Dr Dre signed the kid, watch Compton blow
We got a Cali gangbanger with a Yonkers flow
Now the streets is talking, wanna know where Dre found him
In that Impala, the same Impala I keep my pound in
Ain't no telling what the Game will do, muthafucka
I'll blow the guts out the dutch and do the same to you
And just to get shit cracking, I'll drop the toaster
Grab the Louie go Sammy Sosa
And you ain't gotta know me to know that
I hop out a new pink Rolls, with the '52 Pete Rose throwback
Haze in my eyes, listening to Bobby Womack
On the same corner where Eazy E sold coke at
I'm the nigga that'll smoke the purple
Get high as a kite, down half the Grey Goose
And choke one of your workers
Don't make me put two in your shirt
Dog, I'm putting in work
Then move bags like Dooney and Bourke
Then stuff work in the GMC
Cause on my block, I'm the king of rock like Run DMC
And I'll come through in the tan prowler
With guns in the stash
That'll turn your man face into clam chowder
Hold that damn powder, my niggas will squeeze
And bust all night like it's New Year's Eve
So lace your Timbs and polish your Gators
We like odds in Vegas
You can't ball then it's probably the haters
You can't breathe, then it's probably the desert
If you a gangsta or not
I give a fuck dog, bullets is hot
And you can find me in the hood with rocks in the Pyrex
Tan khakis and them Nike Airs with the dyed checks
So you know my CK's in your mommy's hamper
Cause I got a six tre that changes colors like Jolly Ranchers
And Busta Rhymes told me how to make money
If it ain't rap, it's the mac
Run up on you and take money
Now I signed with the 'math, I got out-of-state money
White boy from Yale, Cancun spring break money
Canary yellow diamonds in my chain, take honey
To the Four Seasons, before 4 I'm skeetin'
Before 5 she leaving
I know her man and I know what a four-five will leave him
On Rosecrans bleeding
The old man seen em', and he won't tell
He on a seafood diet and he don't eat shells
Ghost town back on the map, we gon' eat well
Nieces and nephews, Barbie cars with Sprewells
Ask around, they'll tell you I'm good with the raw cane
And skipped college then handle the rock like LeBron James
And I ain't mean to take shots at The Roc, or call names
Tell Jay when he visits LA to call Game
Let him know I squashed that beef, I'm bigger than that
In 5 years, I'm trying to be where Jigga is at
The CPT, that's where me and my niggas is at
Standing by that new Ferrari, liquorish black
And I got a story to tell, my yay talks to me
But, nobody believes that my yay talks to me
Late night in the coupe, Marvin Gaye talks to me
When I'm gangsta leaning, twisting purple haze off Remy
And the rims ain't cost me a penny
Came in the dice game
Z with the white frame and go with the Pumas
Think about it, you can die sooner
Got my 40 from Cincinnati and it throws bullets like boomer
Fuck a rumor, I copped a Lamborghini
Ride with the AC on
Red rag over my face and an Angels beanie
When you see me in the streets, it's real
It ain't no bangin on wax nigga, Compton is back
These rap niggas is hoes, need to holler at Don Juan
Faggot niggas with g strings under their Sean Jean
I'll let em' have it on a Compton strip, clip for clip
Or walk block for block through Harlem with Von Zip
Black Chuck Taylors, canaries shining on my wrist
With a desert and a line and grindin' like The Clipse
And they don't know if I'm a Blood or a Crip
When they see me rock the cherry khaki suit
Inside a smerf blue 6
And the fifth get em' downtown faster than 5 tokens
And put niggas in the ICU like bifocals
And I kill bi-coastal
I'll smash your Jersey
J. Kidd or the yellow and purple
The harder the nigga, the harder the work is
So I get high and listen to Pac's first shit before I write verses
I'm the Shaq on the block, Kobe with the rock
West with the shot, so nickname my johnson ""Earvin""
Don't get murdered
I got a Glock in the holster
That'll blow your fucking brains off the top of your shoulders
Dog, I keep it gangsta like I'm supposed to
With a 12 guage shotty and that Testarossa
NWA soldier, I'm no good, I'm so hood
Holla if you wanna die that bad, I bust guns that fast
And I rock my rag, like it's 88 and niggas still rockin' Shaft
So put the hundreds in the bag
Or I'ma put the eagle to your helmet
And the 5th to your chest like Donovan McNabb
I keep 16 in the clip, and I'll let em' all go
Like The Lakers did Elton, Eddie and Nick
We got bricks for 11.5, So many fiends
It's like a nigga been on the same corner since '75
NWA will never die
And I'm Compton's most wanted
100 bars and runnin!

Look what the fuck the wind blew in
Yo Clue, you better let em' know, nigga
This is Aftermath's young gun
Oh, you thought it was hard to get a deal on the west before?
Welcome to them fucking record labels now
If you ain't spitting like The Game
And 10 bars or less, your shit is a frisbee, nigga
So you better be concerned
This is Chuck Taylor, muthafucka
And I'll bring the west coast back by myself if I got to
You don't believe me?
Ask the nigga standing next to you
See what the fuck he got to say
Holla"
70,Big Daddy Kane,28 Bars Of Kane,,"On the streets of Brooklyn, you see this kid looking
Tightning his MJ's, white and cement grey
You're sure to see a pair of Jordan 3's
Now you wanna talk legendary talk to me
Some break records, so no one forget 'em
But we don't break records, we the ones to set 'em
What's in a legend but cutting edges, perfection
With one obsession for staying on the top of his profession
And if it ain't broke, we don't fix it
And no remixes, no pre-fixes
And if it ain't hot we ain't repping it
You ain't getting no half stepping
Half court lames that could never play a full
Any little game just to see what they could call
A wolf in sheep clothing gonna lie and say it's wool
You wanna be like Mike then save the bull
Many try to stick 'em, many try to pick 'em
And think slow, you made your D silent like Django
A broken ankle, and now your tanks low
One octane, but homie, not Kane for short
It's evident I'm the rawest specimen
Warlords and testaments to change your regimen
Spitting to the beat or either the record spin
You wanna see the magic? All I need is just a pen
Sheer excellence, to say thus far
You can ask Isaac Newton how you greet a star
You asked for 16, I went way too far
And I gave you 28, just to raise the bars"
71,Big Daddy Kane,2 Da Good Tymz,Veteranz Day,"Times was simply plain I knew they'd eventually change
Let's take a trip down memory lane
With the game talker, native new yorker
Gators on my feet, formerly british walker
Yes love, that's how it was before
When you was funky fresh or down by law
Parlay with your crew at the corner store
Carrying a boom box 'til your arms were sore
We be wildin' on the corner free stylin'
Or politickin' 'bout doe we see pilin'
Or either girls we be getting with, how we be hitting it
Lying bout skins that we didn't get
Slow moving at paces through the rat races
The jordache look and fat laces
Making moves any type of way
I remember it like yesterday, hey
Chorus
Here's to you
That's how it was before
When you was funky fresh or down by law
Way back in the days how we used to do
Thank you for the good times y'all
Repeat
Verse 2
D?ja vu, things ain't nothing new
Shorties make me think how we used to do
When you couldn't be sleeping, if you plan on keeping
Hold of your sheepskin, heads do be peeping
Think it can't happen to you, now could it?
Came to school wearing Puma's went home barefooted
And on the weekends when everybody click
To slide to the deuce to check karate flicks
Come back around the way after dark
So the crew could embark on the jam in the park
What would happen that night, was to scrap in a fight
Only way to break it up was playing Rappers Delight
And as I sit back watching you
Shorties out there doing what you got to do
I feel for you being sincere
Cause where you trying to go I already been there, yeah
Chorus
Verse 3
Ain't nothing but love I got to give
I don't playa hate cause we all got to live
That negative lifestyle I prohibit
Good life I got to live it, bubbly I got to sip it
Now I'll admit that I sort of be flashing
But yet and still I do it in an orderly fashion
Bring on the honeys and watch me mack these, stack cheese
Go on with your bad self, black caes
Just when the game got the stakes set high
Straight from bed stuy, the return of the jedi
With a jewel cause I'm tired of seeing
Charges being brought up, on brothers getting caught up
Now it's about time we connect, organize and collect
A new wold order's in effect
I send this out to the shorties in the hood
I wanna see you all live good"
72,Ol' Dirty Bastard,96 recreation (demo),,"Yeah, start wit that one
Yo, yo, yo, my acustic futuristic lingustic rap fabric
Is a mixture of arabic sandscript in it?s italics
I talk quick, y?all bitches can?t comprehend my dick release spit
Wit love should I release hits
We travel through bodies like blood vessels
All y?all crab niggas try to wrestle to be on top of this pedastool
Slang doctrine, minoxin, lyrical toxin, I?m chessboxin
Words is rushin through like a herd of angry oxen!!
Fatal for these pussy cat niggas is dead weight
Concentrate, my murder rate excellerate, terminate
So spoil like coke in the foil
Knock knock, I shot the whole block
Electricity, flow splendidly
Internally inside of me like tony starks tee
I create excellency, one-sixty call l-o-u-n-g assist me
Papi wardrobe is key, roll promptly
For slang hall, vocabulary igor, frankenstein mind
Rewind for a minute while I dig down your track, stupid
I move quick shit is accurate, kojack tactics
Chaos, killa bee minds, high society blackness, spread the rumor
My lyrical marv-el makin more cream than carvel
Y?all niggas best to hold your weight like barbell
To my verbal swordsman school, students don?t play truant
My most prudent pupil, rhyme under influence
Of alcohol and to-bacco, mushrooms imported from morocco
Bellies on the rocks, and a twenty sack of choco
Wit forty tales and gold around the fist, bitch I carve
Glitters on the paper so my family won?t starve
I?m deep in the shit, I stay highly involved
Never inconceited, never been beated
Been trapped in many wars but not yet retreated
My style you need it, I just write to read it
It?s all fresh lyric, no nothing gets repeated
I came a long way and guess what, I succeeded
I conquer my opponent, and feed him baby food
Cuz he?s childish and illiterate, and ye has been rude
To the father year me, o-r-i-g
Respond to the war wit the killa bee law
Scavenger nigga, you?s a shhriimp
A full line of shhiit, my ear can digest iiit
Stop drinkin all that water, let?s take it to the land
So I can godzilla up your shit mister tiny tim man
Niggas be creepin up my beanstalk
When I start to come down on your fuckin ass
You tried to chop shit on up
Played my shit like parks bitch, I?m that
Legendary microphone?s weaponary
You secondary bitch-ass fairies
Scary cats won?t survive this verbal attack
You think you?re slang can match
The wu-tang, emphatically now cypher
You fake crumbs, you should be stung on your tongue
While you young guns bunge, we plunge into the grunge
Deep into the dark dungeon, we come in one wind
Nine minds combine to form the wisest rhyme force to summon
I be the quoted mathematical combination
Unloadin mysteries of life, you feel my solar wind blowin
Just then, I came on the stage like wind
Blew slang in your face and it touch your skin
You felt chilly, just like you smoked a bag of illy
You need a coat just to protect your throat
Two pairs of socks, kid I?m cold like ice rise
Chap-lipped duds can?t fuck wit the chatterbox
Cherry heads felt the draft of the ox
Shaolin niggas won?t fuck wit one block *pause*
Broke forgot about half the slang murderer
Down wit the union big street sling murderer
Terrorizin, move I?m tranquelizin
Fast getaway wit the slow speed drivin
Two miles an hour, cappa do it wit the power
Somebody blow something, cut fool in the tower"

Got to check your blood, take you to church

Ever since birth
White man always trying to take the Black man's turf
Black man built America
I named you after Asia, you ain't my Momma
Now her name is Erika, Bo Derek-ah
What, you like that slave name
It wasn't 'posed to sound better
New Wu order, New Rule order
For all the maniacs in jail read this letter
Be behind me when I'm making this cheddar

74,Mobb Deep,Adrenaline,Murda Muzik,"It's that war shit
It's that war shit
And you know what dun

It makes you sick to hear the Mobb bang like this
Infamous for the world to hate or play this
Don't give a fuck if you can't rock to this
My duns heads bop to this
We stand out like a terrace
And make more noise than them other rap niggas
No gimmicks
Just pure adrenaline
Raw lyrics incredible beats
Don't mean to rub it in
But your small time beneath our feet
Straight ass cheeks niggas be askin
For ass whippings
Guns kick like Pel?
My big shit be jumping like Jordan
Often lay a man down on the floor when it gets like that
I'm not blowing off rounds so you can hear sounds
So you can run back actin like you a vet
And swearin' you dead
You survived some real shit
Now what's this it's not going down like this
Ground that nigga like punishment
Dumpin' out full clips when we dumb out
Though I'd rather do music and chill the fuck out
Dun you bugged out I'm trying to walk a peaceful route
But niggas always got mouth until that piece come out
Niggas always gonna think something sweet
Until they least expect you bringing action exactly

It be the guns, money, pussy, cars, drugs, jewels, clothes
Brawls, killings, boroughs, buildings, disease, stress, in these ,N.Y.C

Feel the gat blow while your shit rips
My shit'll hit while you letting niggas go
So you can lower the wrist
That'll only put odds against any attempt
Any provoke uprise you ain't got it in you
First of all you too soft for fastball
Point game track y'all merk like a jaguar nascar
And be out buck 80 on the slow mar
Hennesy spillin' all over my radar
Stay charged niggas getting amped off the mobb shit
Have you wilding out on some club shit
Fit to make you dance at the same time
Stop and glance
Slap flames out the nigga with the wrong idea
Young shit with young mind but that quite contraire
Young nigga smart nigga
Who started from the stairs
How dare
You try to come around the way
In fear like a nigga that been there for years
Shout words that we live but don't play with it
Cause when the shit go down you be like they did it


Taste test this Military shit
Bitches love this
They mans wanna dub this
Thugness it ain't easy to find
Shit like mine I'm a rare species
You's a dime a gross
That's a dozen heast the least
Keep silence the most
Regulate with the rest of my establishment
Blast out the pockets of coats
Make the cops boat
I break down your whole background yo
Irons...a permanent flesh your clothes soakin'
You feel the shots pain every heartbeat throbbin'
Don't get excited you'll only make it worse fighting
Spent most of my nights graveyard shifting
Make burial grounds be that man grim reaper
With all pleasure
Lift his feet up
Pick your heat up
Let's do it like the crematory
Make it hot make the temperature rise like mercury

When I feel like getting bent
Yo don't fuck with it dun
I'mma drink away the pain until the brain get numb
Can't take all my dogs getting lost in the fog
Never to return I guess they heard God's call
And nature don't surprise me now
Prepare for the worst and never believe the silver line clouds
Scrutinize crowds
My surroundings
Get suspect we start four-pounding shit
Picture me up in the mix
With the next man broke and is on my dick
A good man of plenty but an enemy it was clear
I just be another problem that he feenin' to fix
But I can't have that
Pull out I try to grab that
Caught one nigga like Mahadat

So let's get it right"

I just wanna die today
I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive

I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?

You don't gotta die
Now lemme tell you why

It's the very first breath
When your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air
When you're there
Chest to chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long
And seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

I don't wanna die today
I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die

Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive
I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymore"

 Yo-ho-ho and a bag of indo!
 16 men till there's no one left
 Yo-ho-ho and a bag of indo!
Verse One: B-Real
So many fuckin emcees claim supremacy
On whose got hip-hop locked, it could never be
One who is solo, runnin the whole game
That's bullshit, like cops never sniffed cocaine
But I'm taking on all comers, droppin bombers
Reducin numbers, makin it hot like the summer
This, one emcee he couldn't deal with the skill
Like Jack did Jill, I rolled his ass down the Hill
Beaten broken and coughin and chokin on the rhyme
Like a hooker, suckin a dick for the first time
His, rhyme was hollow with no flow to follow
Bust a nut, all in your mouth, and made him swollow
I take 16 emcees, lock em in a room
Make em feel the contact, eatin the mushrooms
Playin with your mind, makin you feel the Force
Had to cancel out, two punk niggas up in The Source
Tried to get XXL, they still fell
Bitches go tell your troubles to Montel
 16 men now there's 13 left
 Yo-ho-ho and a bag of indo!
 16 men now there's 13 left
 Yo-ho-ho and a bag of indo!
Verse Two: B-Real
I'm trippin on the people controllin the airwaves
Got it goin on, you know it all, but God save
Your ass for clashin with the Soul Assassin
That's like Mike fuckin with Poppa Joe Jackson
Ass-whoop all over the place, you can't hide behind
The physical, better run to the spiritual
Ass-whoop critical, or you can get it
From the lyrical, bitch-made niggas are invisible
Dysfunctional, hypocritical, smile in your face
The fuckin cynical shit brains
As I sit back and say, TALLY-HO!
One of these days your punk ass gonna go
Guess you had a key to figure the fuckin flow
But you're locked out, and the bomb's about to blow
 16 men let me see who's next
 Yo-ho-ho and a bag of indo!
 16 men till there's no one left
 Yo-ho-ho and a bag of indo!
Verse Three: B-Real
Twelve punks to go, who's next on the list
Matter of fact I got one in my head to fix
There was one particular fool in the circle who fell off
Greed overcame the nigga who at all costs
Changed up to gain it all, but shared none
Who made him all the money to overcome?
Niggas up on the Hill, in the lab
He was rollin big balla style, high profile
Oh child, make me wanna act juvenile
All smiles, right in my face, but wait a minute now
Welcome to the 360, degrees
Pay a fee when you fuckin your people over the cheese
No soul, no conscience, no loyalty
To the niggas who got him treated, like royalty
Aiyyo time's up, you're gonna end up seein visions
Of everybody, you fucked over, you're Scared Sober
 16 men till there's no one left
 Yo-ho-ho them niggas has gotta go
 16 men till there's no one left
 Yo-ho-ho them niggas has gotta go
Verse Four: B-Real
Fuck the hater with the symbol and no soul
And that bitch nigga who stole my car stereo
Trick Deez, gets no love, she gets nuts
Like Ass Miller, and that fuckin ex-dealer
Can't forget the nigga who was down with the Hill-a
And that punk who tried to dip into the squealer
You get bucked like C. Tucker and Will Bennett
Let me step, over the hump, and represent it
You go down like Jerry, and get smacked
Like Trick Leo, now here's your fuckin eulogy-o!
 That was 16 men now there's no one left
 Yo-ho-ho and a bag of indo
 16 men now there's no one left
 Yo-ho-ho and a bag of indo"
81,Cypress Hill,3 Lil' Putos,Black Sunday,"""Live and direct""
One little two little three little putos
Tried to jack me they got the boot-o
Taking no shit when push comes to shove
Cause a nigga showed me no love
Step back punk cause I'm a Latino
What I bring you is the hardcore lingo
Funky, but ya don't understand
Now I gotta stand with the Glock in my hand
No scope
And there's no hope
Cause I'm dishin'
Out my .45 slug and it ain't missin'
Here it comes hissin'
Here it comes hummin' at ya
Now the slug is comin' at ya
One little two little three hoodlums
Gotta hit the ground cause here the slug comes
What do you know, click clack goes the gun
Make 'em run boy, make 'em run boy, make 'em run
Cuando entro, loaded is the cuete
Speakin' to the gente
Cause I'm insane in the mente
Movin' em back, click-click goes the gun
Make 'em run boy, make 'em run boy, make 'em run
It's no fun
When I got to break you off some
Of the psycobeta beatdown, boy you get done
Serio
Here we go
Come for the muchacho
I don't think you really want some of these chingazos
Me caso you don't hear this little lazo
Cypress Hill, breaking you off a pedazo
Humming at ya
Don't make me come gatt ya
Punk cause I still will be comin' at ya
One little two little three hoodlums
Gotta hit the ground cause here the slug comes
What do you know, click clack goes the gun
Make 'em run boy, make 'em run boy, make 'em run
When I come in, kickin' with a vengeance
Swift of the engines
Coming like the three little indians
Stompin' around on the ground on the plains
Cause a nigga like me is goin' insane
In the brain
So I gotta maintain
My direction
What I mighta gained
Without my protection
Not a damn thing
So when I come just bring
That new style, break ya off like a chicken wing
Buckooock!!
So you can just suck my cock
Like a fat blunt, stoned is the way of the walk
When I'm peepin'
Checkin' out the punk-ass creepin'
I let the dogs loose then I let the dogs sick 'em
Graaah! Nigga don't make me catch ya
Punk cause I still will be comin' at ya
One little two little three hoodlums
Gotta hit the ground cause here the slug comes
What do you know, click clack goes the gun
Make 'em run boy, make 'em run boy, make 'em run"

Turn up your stereo,equalize treble
Bass be kickin' stupid hard as metal
On the mic tonight that's right your rhyme opponent
M.C. Ice T just microphonin'
33 and 1/3 revolutions per minute
This record is def because my heart is in it
Vocals laid by the Ice,tempos tight and precise
Special effects will be created by an editor's splice
The funk is in it,ya dig it so stop that frontin'
Bust a move to my groove work your body do somethin'
No way in the world that you can deny my method
As my record rotates,my words get more impressive
I'm an M.C., Evil's my Dj on Sire Records not M.C.A
C.B.S.,Capitol,cause they move too slow
Now Sire/Warner Bros. clocks all the dough
As the record revolves money's gettin' made
A.S.C.A.P. pays me every time it's played
I chill in def leathers pure silks and suede
And the gold around my neck will never fade
Down with my Syndicate organized rhyme
Kickin' def tempos that I design
And if you can't hear'em thats such a crime
You better wash your dirty ears with some 409
I always rhyme elite,stay on beat
Travel in a posse when I walk the street
Loved to say my rhymes when I used to max
Now I don't speak much,I save my words for wax
I just wanna make a little point in this song
With a little nonsense we can all get along and on and on
Till the break'a break of dawn
This jam will never play out because the grooves too strong
Guys grab a girl,girls grab a guy
If a guy wants a guy,please take it outside
I wanna make ya enjoy yourself
On the mic tonight Ice T!!Who else?
Evil's on the cuts,Henry Gee's shot gun
Islam's my producer,Bambattas son
Bronx Style Bob's cold watchin' my back

83,Ice-T,6 'N the Mornin',Rhyme Pays,"6 in the morning, police at my door
Fresh Adidas squeak across the bathroom floor
Out my back window I make a escape
Don't even get a chance to grab my old school tape
Mad with no music, but happy cause free
And the streets to a player is the place to be
Got a knot in my pocket, weighing at least a grand
Gold on my neck, my pistols close at hand
I'm a self-made monster of the city streets
Remotely controlled by hard hip-hop beats
But just living in the city is a serious task
Didn't know what the cops wanted, didn't have time to ask


Seen my homeboys cooling way way out
Told 'em bout my morning cold bugged' em out
Shot a little dice til my knees got sore
Kicked around some stories bout the night before
Posse to the corner where the fly girls chill
Threw action at some freaks until one bitch got ill
She started acting silly simply would not quit
Called us all punk pussies, said we all weren't shit
As we walked over to her, ho continued to speak
So we beat the bitch down in the goddamn street
But just living in the city is a serious task
Bitch didn't know what hit her, didn't have time to ask

-Word-

Continued clocking freaks with immense posterior
Rolling in a Blazer with a louie interior
Solid gold the ride was raw, bust a left turn was on Crenshaw
Sean-e-sean was the driver, known to give freaks hell
Had a beeper goin' off like a high school bell
Looked in the mirror, what did we see?
Fucking blue lights: L.A.P.D
Pigs searched our car, their day was made
Found an Uzi, .44 and a hand grenade
Threw us in the county high power block, no freaks to see no beats to rock
Didn't want trouble but the shit must fly, squabbled this sucker shanked em in the eye
But just living in the county is a serious task
Nigga didn't know what happened, didn't have time to ask


Back on the streets after five and a deuce
Seven years later but still had the juice
My homeboy Ken Gee put me up the track
Told me E's rolling Villain, BJ's got the sack
Bruce is a giant - Nat C's clocking dough
Be bop's a pimp, my old freaks a ho
The batter rams rolling, rocks are the thing
Life has no meaning and money is king
Then he looked at me slowly and Hen had to grin
He said, man you out early, we thought you got ten
Opened his safe kicked me down with cold cash
Knew I would get busy, he didn't waste time to ask


I bought a Benz with the money the rest went to clothes
Went to the strip started pimping the hoes
My hair had grew long on my seven year stay
And when I got it done on my shoulders it lay
Hard from the joint but fly to my heart
I didn't want trouble but the shit had to start
Out with my crew, some punks got loud
Shot gun blasts echoed through the crowd
Six punks hit, two punks died
All causalities was applied to their side
Human lives has to pass just for talking much trash
We didn't know who they were, no one had the time to ask


Swat team leader yelled, hit the floor
Reached in my pocket pulled my .44
Dove across the room peeped out the window
Twenty cops jumped behind a Pinto
Out the back door like some damn track stars
Broke down an alley jumped into a car
Suckers didn't even see us, they musta been blind
Black wire touched red the car was mine
We hadn't done nothing but some suckers got shot
Hit the first turn, goddamn road block
Broke through the block and we did it fast
Cops wouldn't shot us on sight, they wouldn't took time to ask


The rollers gave chase at a serious speed, one more conviction was all I need
This shit was for real, it was no La-Di-Da-Di
Cause the boys had to pin the shit on somebody
And me and my crew, we were known to get ill
We carried heat for protection but not to kill
We bust a corner doing 60, one police car spun
And all I was thinking was, murder one
Bust a move into an alley and did it right
And me and my crew, we're gone into the night
Broke to my old lady's who drew me a bath
She didn't even know what happened, didn't care, didn't ask


We made love like crazy on top of the sheets
This girlie was my worlie, a natural freak
She ran her tongue over each and every part of me
Then she rocked my Amadeus while I watched TV
A technician with a mission that's what she was
If there had been a crowd she would of got an applause
This girl did everything on Earth to me that could be done
The she backed off and teased me so I couldn't cum
Then she cold got stupid pushed me on the floor
Had me begging to stop as I was screaming for more
After she waxed my body she let me crash
She knew her loving was def, she didn't waste time to ask


Up the next morning, feeling good as hell
Sleeping with a girlie sure beats a cell
Hit the boulevard in my A.M.G
Ho's catching whiplash, trying to glimpse the T
Ring on my mobile yes cellular
Got to have a phone when I'm in my car
Was my homeboy Red Some say he's insane
Broke his bitch jaw for smoking 'caine
Told me to meet him at the airport
Said he's jumping bail said he just left court
Caught the first thing smoking in a serious dash
Didn't know where we were going, didn't care, didn't ask


Fell asleep on the plane and so did he, woke up chilling in N.Y.C
Called up my posse when I got there, hit the Latin Quarter and Union Square
Rooftop devil's nest the rest we passed, back doored the Palladium just for class
About 4 a.m. we crashed the deuce, we never catch static cause my boys got juice
Deuced it to the Bronx to rest our heads
Where a shoot-out jumped off, nine people lay dead
It sounded like it happened with a Mac-10 blast
But it was 6 in the morning, we didn't wake up to ask"
84,Lupe Fiasco,1st & 15th,,"Say is this home
Widely received, whenever I touchdown
Call me Young Touchdown, nothin' deeper than the end zone
I had a good year, like the blimp Ice Cube's a pimp on
I lips poem, the same blocks where I made everything rock like Flintstones
Drop with the rims on, clock with the gemstones
Can't call it like blocks on a Sprint phone
Flow incredible, remember, L-U-P-Emperor
Nickname December, move birds like winter
Mind on my tender, move words like verb
Drop lines like ""enter""
Go on and get it Crunk
I ain't really gotta jump like centers
Wait, while you popping and panicking
Peep the demeanor that I'm standing in
Unfazed like I'm mocking a mannequin
Don't think its fluff cause the pampering
I'm still ruff like the unpaid man
Like the unpaved Madison
Straight where I stay like dogs that don't move
Obedient school made me so cool
I was so unruly
I used to chase cars, run behind female dogs
Wouldn't sit with shit
Now you cats can't move me

I'm a chaser
And niggas tryin' to take me off my paper
Like erasers
Let me put you on to somethin'
All I got is the other end for them
And their brother men that wanna get it bubblin'
It's nothing
So be clear
Like I'll pretend that me here
Not just help a friend, believe it
But if you feel you need it
Then I can be your last one like Jesus
With the ease to speak your English
You could be as hard as sign language with no fingers
Drama for the Domas, sky it so it lingers
And you'll never forget, like elephants
Thought you had yourself a slippa, like Cinderella prince
But instead you got yourself pimpa
Who wasn't hesitant to help yo limp like impotence Jack
Viagra to be more exact, Emperor to Emgera
Perhaps I rap to much on the issue
It's back to my ritual
We'll be back
If I happen to miss you
Clappin' the pistol
Burning like clap when you piss dude
Laughin' a little"

Talk with slang, who ball from New York to Spain

I speak, get it clear like lalique crystals
Keep a vigil, your peeps want me to sleep where the fish do
So when I sleep I keep my eyes open like a fish do
So official, he's a gift too, give to them who ah
Wanna see me in hell like breathin' in
With nines to blow my mind like Eve and Gwen
Don't speak to him, he get offended by words
And send in them birds to get him disturbed
While they got in their cars and protectin' their pockets like
Revenge of The Nerd, ob-serve, games I play no like
Injured ankle, pulled hamstring glass half empty but full canteen
They always wanna rub you off when you lamping but...


It's the young capital, L-U from the Avenue
Brush natural(???) in suttin' plus casual
Lay a mac to get the mackerel(???), hush mad atchu
Plus bullet stack crush clavicle and other bones
Run up in ya mother homes, still in the office hustle on
I got the forte of a young Boston Jorge who want horse play?
Thorough Breds wit colt 45's in a Porsche
Bring it to your doorway, we all from the streets
But you do it the Broadway, you know? The kid handle who
Toys better, you better play right like Andrew Lloyd Webber
Never, change when I'm back at the source
Niggas chains in the back of the Source
So I gotta watch for that rob report, rock watches out the Robb Report
And cop copper out the cop revolver


This the nigga that, push lambs in brook-land
Party with thieves, keep geneves at inner in the sleeve
And cook grams, you wanna see me oxed up, propped up
Judge cotched up over my cases, me and K Swiss, please
Small drop for the races, rocks for the bracelets
Glocks for the waist, you ain't want what I pulled out
The dressing draw, get pulled out like dresser draws
Now undress till you draw, raw salmonella, 40 cal. Carrera
Excel-or, right on top like umbrella, wait young fella
Hold your horses like Trojan forces, of course this is

Yo, yo, the A-1 sauce, the Divine Force
My mind blind force is known to blow time off course
Even, if I rode around the world on a blind horse
Strapped down, I'd still get my point across
Allah is father of all
You debate whether big, whether small
Whether short, whether tall
Whether dense, whether length
Whether strength, whether width
Either man, animal, bird or fish
Whether, black or white, more shapes than snowflakes
Existin', everywhere but you still can't locate
The man of steel couldn't bend me
Time couldn't end me
Even the great devil Satan that tried to befriend me
Understand the equality, God in a bodily form
Lettin' my knowledge be born
Lettin' my knowledge be born

Filled with explosives, your chance is hopeless

In the scale of justice and my heart remains balanced and neutral
My respect for all men is mutual
As my thoughts surpass a level to which you devils compute to
You've been given the chance to hear the true and living
So do the knowledge, son, before you do the wisdom
So you can understand, how the thunder and
Lightning above your head is caused by the Son of Man
We experimentin' with high explosions
That cause the place to quake and the surface erosions
The earth produce lava like the mouth produce saliva
This wisdom goes deeper than your scuba diver
In search for the pearl jewels sold to Tiffany
My verbal heart symphony will strike the epiphany
Insight, ignite, and then men might, see love and hell
Hell and right, then excel, to be masters of your circumference
First, by obtainin' mastery of your common sense
This supreme wisdom clears a man's vision
You can see it through the lies and the phantasm
Of the equivocal, two-faced political individual
Who's only out for residual, fabricatin' lies
To eradicate the wise
But we come to civilize and gravitate to the skies
Of the heavenly celestial sphere
Trust me, son, it's dear, in between your ears

A day to God is a thousand years
Men walk around with a thousand fears
The true joy of love bring a thousand tears
In the world of desire, there's a thousand snares

88,GZA,0% Finance,Pro Tools,"I took her off the showroom floor no money down
Near the Chrysler building in the heart of Midtown
200 horse-power under the hood
Junk in the trunk very far from damaged goods
Designer frames with windshields that stay tinted
The most beautiful thing someone invented
Her wrangler had a sticker on the bumper
A sign in case tow trucks tried to dump her
Rear view mirror that of Serena William
Staring was a crime then the look, kill 'em
Brushless showers and the Brazilian wax
Cash in the glove compartment free from tax
Low mileage on the odometer
Graduate with more degrees than a thermometer
Spark plugs for great conversation
She would focus on the finish line and destination
Steering in the right direction
Made sure I wore seat belts had air bags for protection
In her tank she loved to stash my tool
I kept her full, super-unleaded fuel
She had a room full of skirts and rims
The old ones used to swing off ropes that often hung from limbs
A temp at the Ford modeling agency
Suburban area where the Caucasians be
Her great-grandfather was a Cherokee Indian
Explorer and navigator traveling then begin
Sharpening his arrows on Plymouth Rock
Commander-in-chief who raise cattle on the selling of livestock
King of the frontier, rider of thoroughbreds
He was just as sharp as a needle without thread
Legend in truth but known to run the herd
His sons were oldsmobiles who drank thunderbird
Land cruisers sitting on fertile soil
With equipment that ran off expensive oil
Folks bragging said the horse pulled a Volkswagen
They love mustang sally and lollygagging
Fished in Lake Tahoe cooked the barracudas
Hunted impalas with the six-shooters
From a long range with the dog Rover
It was something else to see 'em knock them over

Some got caught in the crossfire
Bunch of rabbits indicating these dudes should retire
One was going bald rocking a sunroof
A gas guzzler in his grill was one tooth
A strong accent, and a beard like Lincoln
Who hated the golf course, but he loved drinking
Avenger, used to pick up chicks
Had magnums that were ram tough but thick
He wore blazers where he used to hide the Ruger
For encounters with the jaguars and cougars
A veteran who could salute and sing the anthem
In accord with the plan he was the phantom
He had a fat lady they called hummer
And umm, she needed body work the whole summer
She had a few friends who used to stay in a pound
Abandoned the parking lots, and junk yard bound
Regulars in rest areas and truck stops
Cassette players, known to make the tape pop
Gold diggers who on the cream like Wells Fargo
In Vegas, they circle around the Monte Carlo
You know the snakes with the fangs and vipers
Bloodsuckers who all used to piss from diapers
Met the Cavaliers at the Outback steakhouse
Chicken cutlets supreme just for takeout
One of them was forced to live in Astoria
Cause at the auction, they had crowned victoria
Since then her friends charged her battery
Had her running off with the sweets of flattery
She kept a loud muffler, couldn't trust her
Police used to always pull over this duster
A pothead who some called a firebird
A foul mouth, who could have used wiser words
Her man used to hustle and ran a crack corner
So insecure he kept LOJACK on her
Creeping with his visors low, high-beaming
Temper would accelerate, private eye scheming
He would check her consoles for rubbers
She would pass the inspection with flying colors
She would turn left if he said right
On her cycle, he would often run red lights
His voiced echoed as she dodged the convo
-----""PROTOOLS""-----
Her previous owner, all he did was bone her
Some drove her crazy, she was just a loner
He had her leaking transmission fluids
Said it was an accident, didn't mean to do it
No insurance with her grill decayed
She sobbed uncontrollably, still stayed
Another total eclipse of the heart
Like the freezing weather that never gave her a start
Plus he had a sidekick in his garage
And if he needed a boost, she would give him a charge
He was sentenced for running an escort service
Escaped from prison but made a few nervous
His baby mother had wifed a BMW
Number one on the list, so he brought trouble to
She done everything to regain her liberty
Tried to be outty, but went into delivery
Moved to Aspen, survived a avalanche
A different element, inside a fatter ranch
Far away, when she changed the pattern
The distance was like from Mercury to Saturn"

700 volts on the track to slay
Murderous wordplay displayed from killing cascades
Throwing bullets in the air to test wind
Which way the cyclone spin? Counter or clockwise?
Still civilized
Kill spies on the wall as still flies, all dies

Give no extension on the lynching
It's tension if the name of the Clan is mentioned
It's the aura that's felt that causes one to flash his gun
And reveal how he really feel, confirmed
He'll never live after the show
See the promoter for the dough I'm taking, breaking his wax
Throwing my shit on to perform the selection from the Swarm
Day 2 breaks, it's a stormy Monday
My ninjas lay in ravines and ditches underneath shrubs and leaves
They breathed through underwater reefs
The enemy walks above, Clan remains subterraned in mud
Off shore banks, tanks approach the location
Bombarded by the circle of death formation
Telecom lines are sniped from these low altitude strikes
Shattering bulletproof helmets with shrapnel fragments of cell
Inhale these venomous thoughts that I propel
Through the north facility, the city must suffer
At the hand of the Chief's command, volts are sent
At three minute intervals the heat intenses
Deadening the power from electrical fences
Defences are down, shake a nigga up
Bounce him off the sound

You know what I'm saying?
The God ca-diver, in the streets of Iris
We talk about sex, money and drugs
(Ruled by power) And y'all cats don't know
What it's about (Love and power)
It goes deeper than what you see on TV
Killah Priest, come on

Burning desire, ebony eyes
Painted toenails, legacies die
Women by the well, Egyptian queens
Arabian sheiks paid to knock off rich kings for the joy some sing
Graveyards filled with scarlet widows
Who stabbed they husbands sleeping on silk pillows
Blood on they robes, disguised as beggar in cheap wool clothes
Lambs and wolves in black hoods pull out they gats
Like magic wands, casting spells, sending niggas to Hell
Trapping they souls in realms
Baptize them with Holy Water
Springing on the heads of plenty witches' daughters
Interviews with the richest reporters, silent nights over Nevada
A thousand Muslims bow before the Kaaba
Hebrews flee to the hills of Masada
For the love of God, guns make a loud sound
I'ma show you how thugs get down
Shootouts, bullets turn into bloodhounds and hunt you down
Cursed nation, lost generation
X-Files found them in the future as cosmic rulers
Fallen angels from space intruders
Dying saints, blood spilled on the floor like wet paint
See it in the pictures, read it like the lost scriptures
Absorb it with your 100 proof liquor

Huh; I shot the sheriff and the deputy secondly
Threatening the lives of those who threaten me
Lessening my chances of defeat by predetermining the victory
As taught by Sun Tzu in the chapter, after the third one
I heard my word shall be born, regardless to anything or anyone
Or else I die by the gun, my life has just begun
Thought I was living all along, but I was wrong
This long road I have to travel in countless battles
These filthy snakes with poison fangs and rattles
Kings, queens and pharaohs changed to cattle
Unable to duck the Devil's arrow
Singing that his eye's on the sparrow, mind narrow
Superstitions, horoscopes and tarots
'Hark Heralds Angels' and Christmas carols
Graven images hang from the mantels
Man-made slaves in modern day Babel
Brought from Africa in golden robes and sandals
By wicked thieves and vandals
Who manhandled us with leather whips and burning candles
And rambled through our castle, leaving niggas shambles
Stole our golden sodas like some Arab camels
We gazed, amazed and baffled as he loaded his ammo
Into the barrel and blasted out our bone marrow
We were the Gretel and the Hansel, tricked by this wicked jackal
Children of my grand-old-daddy have me
In mind when they're lost in this wilderness blind"

I need a dope beat, a dope beat
Just holler at your boy named Warren G(I wanna)
A dope beat(with my), a dope beat
Just holler at your boy named Warren G
Y'all know me, the G from the 213
LBC, Regulatin, skatin' on all them Dayton's
Bankin' back on them singles
With the Henney's and the Jimmy's
Like I'm all tall, short, and like dark, thick and skinny
I'm a ladies' man, Mercedes and
Proper ice, livin' nice, as far as gravy stands
Ain't nuttin' changed, me and Snoop's still the same
Plus Nate droppin' weight with the classic thang
Now I remember way back, at the bachelor set
Slip my brother, Dre, Snoopa tape it, put it in the deck
The party started bangin' and they both shook hands
And made it legitimate for the G-Funk Fans
Now after that, they hit the top when The Chronic dropped
Remember 187 on the motherfuckin' cop(I wanna)
It's Still A G Thang (with my), where we hang and claim
East Side 'til I die, or I rise to fame
(Chorus x2)
I need a dope beat, a dope beat
Just holler at your boy named Warren G(I wanna)
A dope beat(with my), a dope beat
Just holler at your boy named Warren G
I got my own style, I got my own pal
If you don't know now, then nigga, you better slow down
Spendin bills, bendin' wheels, people think I steal
Puttin' cameras in my grill everywhere I chill
Kick back, I spit facts, and twist our tracks
Drank gin with The Twinz, see a bitch I mack
Cuz if I ain't in the studio, I'm deep in the hood
Anyway gettin' paid like Warren should
Dre teachin' me to work a beat, now I'm bangin'
And I been with platinum, now my album slangin' (I wanna)
Hangin' with my G's (with my) from the LBC
With the homies that I know will put it down for me
Well known, keep my chrome, and I hold my own
But I'd rather roll and flow and be holdin' the shows
With the G-Funk Family earnin' a Grammy
You can't see what I see, and don't understand me
(Chorus x2)
I need a dope beat, a dope beat
Just holler at your boy named Warren G(I wanna)
A dope beat(with my), a dope beat
Just holler at your boy named Warren G
I'm on my way to the studio, beatin and thumpin
Scoop D from Long Beach got some heat from Compton
Hit the Eastside manages to see whats crackin
Got some MGD, just watching for jackin
Its a hard knock life, ya heard Jay-Z featuring Annie
No Limit like Snoop, thats when the grammy
Hit the Beach in the Long gray and black caddy
Reminiscing on my great escapes through the alley
Damn I done grew up and things done changed
Just shakin my head, trippin off the game
Its so much you gotta do to keep it real out here
But ain't nothing guaranteed cuz ain't nothing goin' give
(Chorus x3 to fade)
I need a dope beat, a dope beat
Just holler at your boy named Warren G
A dope beat, a dope beat
Just holler at your boy named Warren G"

No matter who the (?) I'm the (?) for your oppression
Standing in my rightful place, residing as it seems
That it's earthed inside the dark, hopefully you catch the gleam
You turn unto the village, you can see how we get tranqued
Seems to pawn follow pawn, and become the queen's bank
I'm not part of that, I may be ghetto, spack
But I'm too smart to embark into the deadly traps
Never gettin' (?) although (?) rarely follows
I pride myself as optimist, but damn this place is hollow
Guess I better hit the grind, fill my jams taut with substance
Sprinkle vibes around with result and abundance
Falling prey to categories can be black and abysmal
Damage to the aura, which encases us like crystal
The raising of the bar, is a part of repertoire
We gon' edit negatives off this little black noir

Abstractionisms, for your daily rhythms/nigga 

Peace everybody, glad I've got your attention
We drove the path of ease, and steer clear of pretention
Now we riding high because the weight inside the trunk
Has been sifted, with specifics, its been shifted for the junk
Here's the funk, and the anchor is the bass that make you wiggle
Don't over-analyze it, it's no need for you to niggle
I stand inside my power, like a knight inside the court
Everybody follow suit, if it's rigid don't abort
It's heavenly, somebody sound the reveille
The day is starting in the rhythm's highest pedigree
I got the beat reverberating and energy's on 10
Sending sound-waves through orals, I revitalize the den
Or deep, it's still TM, everybody's got it in them
Don't hold these words as boring even though you all are snoring
Constantly restoring cause we living and we breathing
I'm injected and infected with this premise I'm not leaving"

94,Xzibit,1983,Napalm,"I think we all have these moments in our life, where we say
Or do things
And we're so sorry for them, really
It's not the way we would have wanted it to come out
Umm, let's face it, this is real life
And this is the thought that was captured from me
That words only share a small portion of the vision that they give witness too

I had to write this in blood, because the ink wouldn't stick
I sold five to six million but, yo, that ain?t really shit
It was supposed to be different, we were supposed to ride out,?
But too much shot his girl, then shot himself in the mouth
Then the steady game form but very soon fell apart,?
?cause when you just doing all, with no the loyalty in your heart,?
It?s like catching Alzheimers on all these niggers forgetting where they?re coming from
And they?re slowing down, wait a minute, what we?re running from?
This what we?re supposed to do, here?s where we?re supposed to be,?
I hated MTV for trying to play me like a mockery
But that don't bother me, I just fulfill my fucking contract
Small price to pay just to take a piece of my back
My back, backfire, assassination of my character
Just to make some millions off of America
My younger sister, Erika, just adopted a child,?
My older brother served fifteen, he made it out
Even though my father loved me, I ain?t seen him in a while
Had to fight my baby momma, bitch, give me my nigga now
?cause he's running out of time and I need him to understand
The way a superior man had build a brand
Niggas talk about my taxes, had to pay to Uncle Sam
I?m surviving cause the mind?s eyes quicker than the hand

Heartbreak, disappointment, my mother died when I was nine
I just wanted to join her
Nah Mr. Joiner, you get to California, I got something for you to do, it was like I was anointed
Resurrected, found my purpose
I remember meeting Dre, being nervous when I would kick my verses
I was virtually worthless, my whole life was a circus
I was sleeping with serpents and I thought it is worth it
Got a call from Paul, told me shit isn?t working
Exchange words, told me tell me that shit in person
He probably told Em, and by the way did he said it unapologetic twisted made about him
I see Slim and he said he didn?t recognize me
Was it that or did he let another man define me
I don?t know, but now I gotta get this all behind me
Follow my calling when I used to follow niggers blindly

I wish I had a better relationship with my uncles
Blood relatives I could turn to when I?m feeling trouble
And talk about my struggles
My uncle John Nail, he only put me on the phone with different females
And this is such a such, nephew, tell 'er, what?s up?
Ain?t even ask about Tremayne and Gatlyn , growing up
Fuck, I drink it all and I smash the bottle
Self medicated numb, but I'mma feel it tomorrow
It feel like pain and sorrow was like a second skin
But now the pain is gone I got my second win
Only the strong live long, you better settle in
I?m fighting for ever, I will never let the devil win
1983, that?s when my journey begins
I searched every world for strength, only to find it within
This for me and my kin, still dying to live
Living life to the fullest 'till I see you again"

96,Talib Kweli,1st Time (feat. Consequence),,"There?s a first time for everything
There?s a first time for everything
But don?t be afraid of what?s in the dark
Just open your eyes and see what?s in they heart
I remember the first time I left it up to you
But I learned from the first time to never trust in you

Ay yo, the first time ever I saw your face
I recall the case
Cut the grass now I see all the snakes
My lawyer man cake
Cause of you he?s been employed by the beef
And now it?s time to half court in the street
Falling asleep on your boy is not recommended
He felt the weapon in your chest because I?m well respected
So when you disrespect reflection then your health effected
I go harder than any demon that hell invented
I never felt threatened
By none of these industry motherfuckers
Cause they smucks and they blood suckers
You can come quicker than sideways or backwards
I always come straight up in your face
Your mistake is confusing me with a rapper
That interviews and a fashion
You assuming I?m passive
I?m really truly a master
Of lyrically moving masses
It?s true but if you attack us
I?m never the one to back off
Never the one to slack off
I?m making them take the mask off
It?s beautiful when I black out, it?s natural like disasters
My body is like a host for a ghost of the middle passage
You not imagining the noise you hear is laughter
They giggle behind your back you enacted your family matters
You read into what?s happening and kill it like an assassin
Looking for that applause when all you get is the clappin?
I?m serious about my craft don?t ever confuse the masses
By taking my outtakes and trying to repackage them
It?s never forgive action


You only get one chance to make a first impression
That?s why I always make sure I come the freshest
Whether I start or my words ending
I?m here to exercise my first amendment
Which gives you the right to get your verse played
I almost lost that after the third grade
Cause on the first and fifteen before I stayed
My team was the first to get paid
So why would you cross us in the first place
Unless you willing to catch a first case
You better all go on on your first date
To see if you can get past first base
This the first taste of what the pain gave me
You listen to the rumors you would think they played me
But they my juniors, my first babies
I only deal with presidents like the first lady
Who pay me on a first name basis
I don?t like you niggas I?m almost racist
That?s why I?m cursing the first person or cursing the first person who didn?t make my first purchase
But type my name in they word searches
Cause I kill the flow bring out the first hearses
And this will be the first crime you ever seen
But it?s cool cause there?s a first time for everything


Before the ink dried and the deal was finalized
And the money changed hands and the plan was monetized
We used to eat mcdonalds fries
Shop for economy size
Know when economists lie
We poor we trying to survive
Another stat-istic of a man with some kind of pride
I?m getting black listed like I?ve got a communist tie
Little did I know it was myself I was trying to find
Getting all kind of high
Crashing like vehicular homicide
But now I?m self employed and I?m chilling
I?m waking up with the millionaires
You looking for the building I?m still in there
Still in fear
Scared of the dark that don?t matter
When the lights come on the cockroaches scatter
Exposing the data
Yo get a load of these actors
They cloak and dagger
See how I broke they swagger
My spirit is rich
Yea the lyrics is sick
Get prepared lyricist of the year in this bitch"
97,Talib Kweli,2000 Seasons,,"Talib Kweli:
Yeah Hi Tek...
Whom do we aspire to reflect on peoples death
Who's entertainment shall we sing our agony
Of our hopes
That the destroyers aspiring to extinguish us will suddenly
Suffer remorse at the sight of their own fantastic success?
The last imbecile to dream that dream is dead
He was killed by the saviors of his own dream
Armah - 2000 seasons
Talib Kweli-Verse 1
I'm not a human being into no spirtual shit
A Spiritual being manifested as a human that's it
When I spit I spray thoughts that's representing my life
Yo I step into the spot leave niggas open like mics
Take on em on a tour
Explore psychologies of war
Things you can't imagine if you've never seen em before
Shorties come back raw
Straight out the c- 74
I welcome them back to the world they think is run by laws
The world is run by men who use laws for tools
I come thru war tactics like Shaka Zulu
Mcs is soft like play-doh
I shape 'em
Smash em to pieces
Volunteer Slaves crave the words I'm painting
The masterpieces
You hear em on the radio babbling
But the truth is traveling with the word
As they're flying through the air like a javelin
Unraveling like a verdict
Pound it in your chest like a gavel in the highest court
In Bablyon, let's travel on
If the world is foul, and you think foul is how you got to live
Then from the get your ass was foul
And foul just is how you is
No excuses see, life's dilemas are set up like a mirror
Just to show you all your faces
Now your clearer understanding is clearer
You had your chance for revolution
You let it pass you by
That's why I'm dissing wack mc's till the day that I die
Reflection getting you high
We stand our ground with the believers
The leaning tower of Pisa and the Pyramids of Giza
No comparison
The way I flip it is embarrassing
Tis the season
Ain't no caroling
Verse 2
All knowing
Flowing like spring water in the desert
Balling through the barren land
Where niggas take a stand, like castles made of sand
Free falling
For anything
Nothing but a plan to fail for they selves
No sense of delf, needed daily affirmations of self help
Yo it's right in front of yo grill stop looking everywhere else
Speaking of planning
Hustling and scheming
Looking for hookups
Took up too much time
Like a fiend for rocks that got cooked up
God bless the child that got his own shit
I got my team's
So the fiends now become opponents
They the opposition
Stronger from competition
Shining like a golden shower, your face I'm pissing in
Completing a genocide mission like
The Warren commission
Like fathers was supposed to be missing
While our sisters were supposed to be whoring
Save it for a rainy day, money is pouring
Under grey clouds, black butterflys still be soaring
Flying in frienldy skies
We classifying the highs
Blood be flowing in the streets like crimson tide in my eyes
Tye be having me drowsy
But I get mellow with the chronic
Intellectuals embarrassed cause we discussing ebonics
I'm on a roll like sonic
In an age that the plague got bubonic proportions
Yo I call it reparations, but they call it extortion
Whatever
Just give me mine
But caution
You've been warned for the very last time
I'm not telling you again
So relay it to your crew
You gotta actually to do
Forget the drive in, driveby and drive through
You've got to
Get out the car
Humble yourself
Tilt your head back, and look at the stars
Shining over someplace very far, from where you standing
When the night is clear
You understanding just who put them there
What you know about the space you get lost in
Your peoples can't hear you in the distortion
The desert is absorption
And you sucked and you stuck off american freezing for like
2000 seasons
Upon your return from raping and crossbreeding
Your own people accuse you of deceiving and misleading
Causing mass confusion. Drug abusing
Now you all caught up in institutions
At this time you've got to break it down and be showing and proving
An A&are told me that I use to many catch phrases
True I'm trying to catch all my people in all different stages all
Different phases
It's like that y'all..."
