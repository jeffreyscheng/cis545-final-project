Bitch I'm Lil B, bitch I'm Lil B
Hoop Life mixtape, you gon' know that it's me
Still on the court and I'm still holding court
Ban me from the game cause you niggas on my dick
I'm a short nigga with a tall ass bitch
Might layup but I'll dunk on a bitch
Shoutout to the WNBA, you got some fine ass girls I wanna fuck in the mouth
Hoop Life mixtape I'mma try it out
I'm at try-outs, tryna' make a route
Fuck all you haters I'mma hop em' out
3 point on a bitch like Dirk Nowitzki
Up in the club like Dirk Nowitzki
See me on the court if you wanna diss me
Lets play a game of 21, its really fun
I got half court shots and I'll post you up
I'm Latrell Sprewell, I'll choke the coach
Street niggas like me either rich or broke
Gotta hustle hard that's all I know
Hoop life bitch that's all I know
Sports lifestyle with a gorgeous flow
With my contract imma buy a ho
Beverly Hills imma buy a home
Fuck KD that's how it go
